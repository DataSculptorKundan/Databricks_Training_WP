A single man of large fortune;\r\n      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\r\n\r\n      “How so? how can it affect them?”\r\n\r\n      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so\r\n      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\r\n      them.”\r\n\r\n      “Is that his design in settling here?”\r\n\r\n      “Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\r\n      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\r\n      must visit him as soon as he comes.”\r\n\r\n      “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\r\n      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\r\n      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you\r\n      the best of the party.”\r\n\r\n      “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\r\n      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\r\n      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\r\n      thinking of her own beauty.”\r\n\r\n      “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\r\n\r\n      “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\r\n      comes into the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n      “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n      “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\r\n      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\r\n      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\r\n      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\r\n      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.”\r\n\r\n      “You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\r\n      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\r\n      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\r\n      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\r\n      little Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n      “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\r\n      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\r\n      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\r\n      giving _her_ the preference.”\r\n\r\n      “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;\r\n      “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\r\n      something more of quickness than her sisters.”\r\n\r\n      “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\r\n      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor\r\n      nerves.”\r\n\r\n      “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\r\n      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\r\n      consideration these twenty years at least.”\r\n\r\n      “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\r\n\r\n      “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\r\n      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n      “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\r\n      will not visit them.”\r\n\r\n      “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\r\n      visit them all.”\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\r\n      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\r\n      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\r\n      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\r\n      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\r\n      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\r\n      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\r\n      solace was visiting and news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\r\n      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\r\n      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\r\n      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\r\n      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\r\n      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\r\n      with,\r\n\r\n      “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n      “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her\r\n      mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\r\n\r\n      “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him\r\n      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\r\n\r\n      “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\r\n      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\r\n      have no opinion of her.”\r\n\r\n      “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that\r\n      you do not depend on her serving you.”\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\r\n      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\r\n\r\n      “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\r\n      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\r\n\r\n      “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she\r\n      times them ill.”\r\n\r\n      “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.\r\n      “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\r\n\r\n      “To-morrow fortnight.”\r\n\r\n      “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come\r\n      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to\r\n      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”\r\n\r\n      “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\r\n      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.”\r\n\r\n      “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\r\n      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”\r\n\r\n      “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is\r\n      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\r\n      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\r\n      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\r\n      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\r\n      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”\r\n\r\n      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\r\n      “Nonsense, nonsense!”\r\n\r\n      “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.\r\n      “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that\r\n      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you\r\n      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep\r\n      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”\r\n\r\n      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\r\n\r\n      “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return\r\n      to Mr. Bingley.”\r\n\r\n      “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\r\n\r\n      “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so\r\n      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not\r\n      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\r\n      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”\r\n\r\n      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\r\n      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first\r\n      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\r\n      had expected all the while.\r\n\r\n      “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\r\n      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\r\n      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is\r\n      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and\r\n      never said a word about it till now.”\r\n\r\n      “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.\r\n      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\r\n      raptures of his wife.\r\n\r\n      “What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the\r\n      door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends\r\n      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of\r\n      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\r\n      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do\r\n      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare\r\n      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”\r\n\r\n      “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\r\n      youngest, I’m the tallest.”\r\n\r\n      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\r\n      would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should\r\n      ask him to dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\r\n      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\r\n      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\r\n      They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,\r\n      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\r\n      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the\r\n      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\r\n      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\r\n      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\r\n      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\r\n      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\r\n      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\r\n      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\r\n\r\n      “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\r\n      Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the\r\n      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\r\n\r\n      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat\r\n      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\r\n      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\r\n      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\r\n      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\r\n      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and\r\n      rode a black horse.\r\n\r\n      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\r\n      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\r\n      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\r\n      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\r\n      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their\r\n      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\r\n      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his\r\n      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be\r\n      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\r\n      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\r\n      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\r\n      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that\r\n      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with\r\n      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of\r\n      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,\r\n      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from\r\n      London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered\r\n      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.\r\n      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another\r\n      young man.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\r\n      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine\r\n      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.\r\n      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\r\n      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\r\n      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general\r\n      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\r\n      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\r\n      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\r\n      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\r\n      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\r\n      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to\r\n      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\r\n      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\r\n      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\r\n      compared with his friend.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\r\n      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\r\n      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and\r\n      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\r\n      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him\r\n      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and\r\n      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\r\n      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the\r\n      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His\r\n      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\r\n      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\r\n      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,\r\n      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\r\n      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\r\n      daughters.\r\n\r\n      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\r\n      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\r\n      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a\r\n      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance\r\n      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\r\n\r\n      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\r\n      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much\r\n      better dance.”\r\n\r\n      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\r\n      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as\r\n      this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and\r\n      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\r\n      punishment to me to stand up with.”\r\n\r\n      “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley,\r\n      “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant\r\n      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of\r\n      them you see uncommonly pretty.”\r\n\r\n      “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said\r\n      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\r\n\r\n      “Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there\r\n      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very\r\n      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner\r\n      to introduce you.”\r\n\r\n      “Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\r\n      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly\r\n      said, “She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I\r\n      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies\r\n      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your\r\n      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with\r\n      me.”\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\r\n      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She\r\n      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for\r\n      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\r\n      anything ridiculous.\r\n\r\n      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\r\n      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\r\n      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she\r\n      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified\r\n      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\r\n      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned\r\n      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\r\n      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough\r\n      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet\r\n      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\r\n      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which\r\n      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still\r\n      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\r\n      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\r\n      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had\r\n      rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be\r\n      disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story\r\n      to hear.\r\n\r\n      “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a\r\n      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had\r\n      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\r\n      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her\r\n      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,\r\n      my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only\r\n      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,\r\n      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;\r\n      but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,\r\n      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\r\n      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,\r\n      and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with\r\n      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth\r\n      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\r\n      _Boulanger_—”\r\n\r\n      “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband\r\n      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s\r\n      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his\r\n      ankle in the first dance!”\r\n\r\n      “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\r\n      handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life\r\n      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace\r\n      upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”\r\n\r\n      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\r\n      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another\r\n      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of\r\n      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\r\n\r\n      “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much\r\n      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid\r\n      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that\r\n      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,\r\n      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance\r\n      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one\r\n      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\r\n      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\r\n      sister how very much she admired him.\r\n\r\n      “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\r\n      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so\r\n      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”\r\n\r\n      “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man\r\n      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\r\n      thereby complete.”\r\n\r\n      “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\r\n      time. I did not expect such a compliment.”\r\n\r\n      “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference\r\n      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_\r\n      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He\r\n      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as\r\n      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for\r\n      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave\r\n      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”\r\n\r\n      “Dear Lizzy!”\r\n\r\n      “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\r\n      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good\r\n      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a\r\n      human being in my life.”\r\n\r\n      “I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always\r\n      speak what I think.”\r\n\r\n      “I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With\r\n      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\r\n      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;—one\r\n      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or\r\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 15650 bytes of output ***\n\n      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a\r\n      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so\r\n      well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does\r\n      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to\r\n      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of\r\n      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the\r\n      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”\r\n\r\n      “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it\r\n      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\r\n\r\n      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,\r\n      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\r\n      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy\r\n      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\r\n      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\r\n      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it\r\n      clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good\r\n      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\r\n      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark\r\n      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\r\n      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure\r\n      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her\r\n      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting\r\n      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was\r\n      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly\r\n      unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable\r\n      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance\r\n      with.\r\n\r\n      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\r\n      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\r\n      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William\r\n      Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.\r\n\r\n      “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening\r\n      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”\r\n\r\n      “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\r\n\r\n      “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\r\n      see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do\r\n      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid\r\n      of him.”\r\n\r\n      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming\r\n      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend\r\n      to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking\r\n      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,\r\n\r\n      “Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\r\n      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a\r\n      ball at Meryton?”\r\n\r\n      “With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\r\n      energetic.”\r\n\r\n      “You are severe on us.”\r\n\r\n      “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am\r\n      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\r\n\r\n      “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always\r\n      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my\r\n      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;\r\n      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who\r\n      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On\r\n      Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well; if it\r\n      must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There\r\n      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar\r\n      with—‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’—and I shall keep\r\n      mine to swell my song.”\r\n\r\n      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a\r\n      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of\r\n      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at\r\n      the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of\r\n      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge\r\n      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\r\n\r\n      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\r\n      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\r\n      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\r\n      excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\r\n      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing\r\n      half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad\r\n      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the\r\n      request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases,\r\n      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end\r\n      of the room.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\r\n      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\r\n      was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir\r\n      William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.\r\n\r\n      “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\r\n      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of\r\n      the first refinements of polished societies.”\r\n\r\n      “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\r\n      amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Every savage\r\n      can dance.”\r\n\r\n      Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\r\n      continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I\r\n      doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\r\n      Darcy.”\r\n\r\n      “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\r\n\r\n      “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\r\n      sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?”\r\n\r\n      “Never, sir.”\r\n\r\n      “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\r\n\r\n      “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid\r\n      it.”\r\n\r\n      “You have a house in town, I conclude?”\r\n\r\n      Mr. Darcy bowed.\r\n\r\n      “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am\r\n      fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that\r\n      the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”\r\n\r\n      He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\r\n      disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\r\n      towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very\r\n      gallant thing, and called out to her,\r\n\r\n      “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must\r\n      allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable\r\n      partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much\r\n      beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given\r\n      it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not\r\n      unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said\r\n      with some discomposure to Sir William,\r\n\r\n      “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I\r\n      entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg\r\n      for a partner.”\r\n\r\n      Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\r\n      honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor\r\n      did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\r\n      persuasion.\r\n\r\n      “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\r\n      deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\r\n      dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am\r\n      sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.”\r\n\r\n      “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\r\n\r\n      “He is, indeed—but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\r\n      Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object\r\n      to such a partner?”\r\n\r\n      Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\r\n      injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with\r\n      some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\r\n\r\n      “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\r\n\r\n      “I should imagine not.”\r\n\r\n      “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\r\n      evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of\r\n      your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet\r\n      the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all\r\n      these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\r\n\r\n      “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\r\n      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great\r\n      pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman\r\n      can bestow.”\r\n\r\n      Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired\r\n      he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\r\n      reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,\r\n\r\n      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\r\n\r\n      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all\r\n      astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray\r\n      when am I to wish you joy?”\r\n\r\n      “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A\r\n      lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\r\n      love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be\r\n      wishing me joy.”\r\n\r\n      “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\r\n      absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,\r\n      indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with\r\n      you.”\r\n\r\n      He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\r\n      entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\r\n      her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\r\n      two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\r\n      entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and\r\n      their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,\r\n      could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been\r\n      an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\r\n      to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\r\n      settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\r\n\r\n      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\r\n      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\r\n      tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\r\n      their aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two\r\n      youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\r\n      frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\r\n      their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to\r\n      Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish\r\n      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the\r\n      country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\r\n      from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\r\n      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia\r\n      regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,\r\n      and Meryton was the headquarters.\r\n\r\n      Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most\r\n      interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their\r\n      knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings\r\n      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the\r\n      officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this\r\n      opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They\r\n      could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large\r\n      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was\r\n      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an\r\n      ensign.\r\n\r\n      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,\r\n      Mr. Bennet coolly observed,\r\n\r\n      “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\r\n      be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it\r\n      some time, but I am now convinced.”\r\n\r\n      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with\r\n      perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\r\n      Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\r\n      day, as he was going the next morning to London.\r\n\r\n      “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be\r\n      so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think\r\n      slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own,\r\n      however.”\r\n\r\n      “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of\r\n      it.”\r\n\r\n      “Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\r\n\r\n      “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\r\n      agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\r\n      particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\r\n      youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.”\r\n\r\n      “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the\r\n      sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I\r\n      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\r\n      I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,\r\n      indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,\r\n      with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I\r\n      shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked\r\n      very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his\r\n      regimentals.”\r\n\r\n      “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\r\n      Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did\r\n      when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\r\n      Clarke’s library.”\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman\r\n      with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the\r\n      servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with\r\n      pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter\r\n      read,\r\n\r\n      “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?\r\n      Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\r\n\r\n      “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\r\n\r\n      “MY DEAR FRIEND,—\r\n      “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa\r\n      and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest\r\n      of our lives, for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women\r\n      can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the\r\n      receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with\r\n      the officers.—Yours ever,\r\n\r\n      “CAROLINE BINGLEY”\r\n\r\n      “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell\r\n      us of _that_.”\r\n\r\n      “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”\r\n\r\n      “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\r\n\r\n      “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\r\n      likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”\r\n\r\n      “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure\r\n      that they would not offer to send her home.”\r\n\r\n      “Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to\r\n      Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\r\n\r\n      “I had much rather go in the coach.”\r\n\r\n      “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\r\n      They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”\r\n\r\n      “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\r\n\r\n      “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s\r\n      purpose will be answered.”\r\n\r\n      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the\r\n      horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on\r\n      horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\r\n      cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane\r\n      had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were\r\n      uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued\r\n      the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not\r\n      come back.\r\n\r\n      “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more\r\n      than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.\r\n      Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the\r\n      felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a\r\n      servant from Netherfield brought the following note for\r\n      Elizabeth:\r\n\r\n      “MY DEAREST LIZZY,—\r\n      “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to\r\n      be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends\r\n      will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also\r\n      on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should\r\n      hear of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and\r\n      headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, &amp;c.”\r\n\r\n      “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\r\n      note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\r\n      illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\r\n      was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\r\n\r\n      “Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\r\n      trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she\r\n      stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I\r\n      could have the carriage.”\r\n\r\n      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\r\n      though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\r\n      horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her\r\n      resolution.\r\n\r\n      “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such\r\n      a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when\r\n      you get there.”\r\n\r\n      “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”\r\n\r\n      “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\r\n      horses?”\r\n\r\n      “No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\r\n      nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back\r\n      by dinner.”\r\n\r\n      “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but\r\n      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\r\n      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\r\n      required.”\r\n\r\n      “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and\r\n      Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\r\n      ladies set off together.\r\n\r\n      “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we\r\n      may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”\r\n\r\n      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings\r\n      of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk\r\n      alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over\r\n      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and\r\n      finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\r\n      ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\r\n      exercise.\r\n\r\n      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\r\n      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\r\n      surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the\r\n      day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible\r\n      to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that\r\n      they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very\r\n      politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was\r\n      something better than politeness; there was good humour and\r\n      kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at\r\n      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy\r\n      which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the\r\n      occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\r\n      thinking only of his breakfast.\r\n\r\n      Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\r\n      Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\r\n      not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken\r\n      to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the\r\n      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note\r\n      how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her\r\n      entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and\r\n      when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little\r\n      beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness\r\n      she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\r\n\r\n      When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and\r\n      Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\r\n      affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary\r\n      came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\r\n      supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\r\n      endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\r\n      and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,\r\n      for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.\r\n      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other\r\n      ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\r\n      nothing to do elsewhere.\r\n\r\n      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\r\n      very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\r\n      and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\r\n      testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\r\n      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\r\n      remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully\r\n      consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint\r\n      the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n      At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\r\n      six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries\r\n      which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of\r\n      distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she\r\n      could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means\r\n      better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\r\n      times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a\r\n      bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;\r\n      and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference\r\n      towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth\r\n      to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\r\n\r\n      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\r\n      could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was\r\n      evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\r\n      prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed\r\n      she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from\r\n      any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister\r\n      scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he\r\n      was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at\r\n      cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,\r\n      had nothing to say to her.\r\n\r\n      When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\r\n      Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her\r\n      manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride\r\n      and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.\r\n      Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,\r\n\r\n      “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being\n</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">[Truncated to first 65536 bytes]\n﻿The Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\r\n\r\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\r\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\r\nwhatsoever.

A single man of large fortune;\r\n      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\r\n\r\n      “How so? how can it affect them?”\r\n\r\n      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so\r\n      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\r\n      them.”\r\n\r\n      “Is that his design in settling here?”\r\n\r\n      “Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\r\n      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\r\n      must visit him as soon as he comes.”\r\n\r\n      “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\r\n      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\r\n      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you\r\n      the best of the party.”\r\n\r\n      “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\r\n      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\r\n      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\r\n      thinking of her own beauty.”\r\n\r\n      “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\r\n\r\n      “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\r\n      comes into the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n      “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n      “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\r\n      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\r\n      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\r\n      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\r\n      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.”\r\n\r\n      “You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\r\n      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\r\n      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\r\n      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\r\n      little Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n      “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\r\n      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\r\n      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\r\n      giving _her_ the preference.”\r\n\r\n      “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;\r\n      “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\r\n      something more of quickness than her sisters.”\r\n\r\n      “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\r\n      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor\r\n      nerves.”\r\n\r\n      “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\r\n      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\r\n      consideration these twenty years at least.”\r\n\r\n      “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\r\n\r\n      “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\r\n      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n      “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\r\n      will not visit them.”\r\n\r\n      “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\r\n      visit them all.”\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\r\n      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\r\n      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\r\n      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\r\n      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\r\n      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\r\n      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\r\n      solace was visiting and news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\r\n      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\r\n      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\r\n      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\r\n      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\r\n      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\r\n      with,\r\n\r\n      “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n      “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her\r\n      mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\r\n\r\n      “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him\r\n      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\r\n\r\n      “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\r\n      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\r\n      have no opinion of her.”\r\n\r\n      “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that\r\n      you do not depend on her serving you.”\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\r\n      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\r\n\r\n      “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\r\n      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\r\n\r\n      “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she\r\n      times them ill.”\r\n\r\n      “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.\r\n      “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\r\n\r\n      “To-morrow fortnight.”\r\n\r\n      “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come\r\n      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to\r\n      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”\r\n\r\n      “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\r\n      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.”\r\n\r\n      “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\r\n      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”\r\n\r\n      “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is\r\n      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\r\n      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\r\n      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\r\n      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\r\n      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”\r\n\r\n      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\r\n      “Nonsense, nonsense!”\r\n\r\n      “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.\r\n      “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that\r\n      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you\r\n      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep\r\n      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”\r\n\r\n      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\r\n\r\n      “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return\r\n      to Mr. Bingley.”\r\n\r\n      “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\r\n\r\n      “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so\r\n      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not\r\n      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\r\n      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”\r\n\r\n      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\r\n      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first\r\n      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\r\n      had expected all the while.\r\n\r\n      “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\r\n      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\r\n      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is\r\n      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and\r\n      never said a word about it till now.”\r\n\r\n      “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.\r\n      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\r\n      raptures of his wife.\r\n\r\n      “What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the\r\n      door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends\r\n      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of\r\n      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\r\n      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do\r\n      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare\r\n      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”\r\n\r\n      “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\r\n      youngest, I’m the tallest.”\r\n\r\n      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\r\n      would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should\r\n      ask him to dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\r\n      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\r\n      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\r\n      They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,\r\n      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\r\n      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the\r\n      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\r\n      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\r\n      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\r\n      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\r\n      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\r\n      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\r\n      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\r\n\r\n      “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\r\n      Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the\r\n      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\r\n\r\n      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat\r\n      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\r\n      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\r\n      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\r\n      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\r\n      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and\r\n      rode a black horse.\r\n\r\n      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\r\n      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\r\n      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\r\n      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\r\n      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their\r\n      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\r\n      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his\r\n      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be\r\n      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\r\n      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\r\n      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\r\n      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that\r\n      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with\r\n      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of\r\n      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,\r\n      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from\r\n      London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered\r\n      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.\r\n      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another\r\n      young man.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\r\n      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine\r\n      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.\r\n      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\r\n      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\r\n      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general\r\n      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\r\n      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\r\n      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\r\n      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\r\n      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\r\n      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to\r\n      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\r\n      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\r\n      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\r\n      compared with his friend.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\r\n      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\r\n      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and\r\n      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\r\n      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him\r\n      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and\r\n      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\r\n      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the\r\n      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His\r\n      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\r\n      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\r\n      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,\r\n      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\r\n      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\r\n      daughters.\r\n\r\n      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\r\n      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\r\n      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a\r\n      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance\r\n      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\r\n\r\n      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\r\n      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much\r\n      better dance.”\r\n\r\n      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\r\n      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as\r\n      this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and\r\n      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\r\n      punishment to me to stand up with.”\r\n\r\n      “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley,\r\n      “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant\r\n      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of\r\n      them you see uncommonly pretty.”\r\n\r\n      “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said\r\n      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\r\n\r\n      “Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there\r\n      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very\r\n      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner\r\n      to introduce you.”\r\n\r\n      “Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\r\n      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly\r\n      said, “She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I\r\n      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies\r\n      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your\r\n      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with\r\n      me.”\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\r\n      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She\r\n      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for\r\n      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\r\n      anything ridiculous.\r\n\r\n      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\r\n      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\r\n      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she\r\n      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified\r\n      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\r\n      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned\r\n      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\r\n      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough\r\n      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet\r\n      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\r\n      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which\r\n      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still\r\n      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\r\n      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\r\n      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had\r\n      rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be\r\n      disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story\r\n      to hear.\r\n\r\n      “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a\r\n      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had\r\n      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\r\n      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her\r\n      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,\r\n      my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only\r\n      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,\r\n      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;\r\n      but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,\r\n      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\r\n      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,\r\n      and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with\r\n      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth\r\n      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\r\n      _Boulanger_—”\r\n\r\n      “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband\r\n      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s\r\n      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his\r\n      ankle in the first dance!”\r\n\r\n      “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\r\n      handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life\r\n      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace\r\n      upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”\r\n\r\n      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\r\n      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another\r\n      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of\r\n      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\r\n\r\n      “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much\r\n      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid\r\n      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that\r\n      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,\r\n      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance\r\n      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one\r\n      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\r\n      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\r\n      sister how very much she admired him.\r\n\r\n      “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\r\n      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so\r\n      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”\r\n\r\n      “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man\r\n      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\r\n      thereby complete.”\r\n\r\n      “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\r\n      time. I did not expect such a compliment.”\r\n\r\n      “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference\r\n      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_\r\n      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He\r\n      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as\r\n      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for\r\n      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave\r\n      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”\r\n\r\n      “Dear Lizzy!”\r\n\r\n      “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\r\n      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good\r\n      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a\r\n      human being in my life.”\r\n\r\n      “I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always\r\n      speak what I think.”\r\n\r\n      “I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With\r\n      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\r\n      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;—one\r\n      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or\r\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 15650 bytes of output ***\n\n      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a\r\n      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so\r\n      well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does\r\n      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to\r\n      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of\r\n      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the\r\n      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”\r\n\r\n      “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it\r\n      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\r\n\r\n      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,\r\n      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\r\n      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy\r\n      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\r\n      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\r\n      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it\r\n      clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good\r\n      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\r\n      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark\r\n      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\r\n      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure\r\n      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her\r\n      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting\r\n      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was\r\n      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly\r\n      unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable\r\n      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance\r\n      with.\r\n\r\n      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\r\n      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\r\n      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William\r\n      Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.\r\n\r\n      “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening\r\n      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”\r\n\r\n      “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\r\n\r\n      “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\r\n      see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do\r\n      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid\r\n      of him.”\r\n\r\n      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming\r\n      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend\r\n      to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking\r\n      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,\r\n\r\n      “Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\r\n      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a\r\n      ball at Meryton?”\r\n\r\n      “With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\r\n      energetic.”\r\n\r\n      “You are severe on us.”\r\n\r\n      “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am\r\n      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\r\n\r\n      “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always\r\n      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my\r\n      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;\r\n      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who\r\n      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On\r\n      Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well; if it\r\n      must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There\r\n      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar\r\n      with—‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’—and I shall keep\r\n      mine to swell my song.”\r\n\r\n      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a\r\n      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of\r\n      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at\r\n      the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of\r\n      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge\r\n      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\r\n\r\n      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\r\n      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\r\n      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\r\n      excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\r\n      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing\r\n      half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad\r\n      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the\r\n      request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases,\r\n      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end\r\n      of the room.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\r\n      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\r\n      was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir\r\n      William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.\r\n\r\n      “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\r\n      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of\r\n      the first refinements of polished societies.”\r\n\r\n      “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\r\n      amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Every savage\r\n      can dance.”\r\n\r\n      Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\r\n      continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I\r\n      doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\r\n      Darcy.”\r\n\r\n      “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\r\n\r\n      “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\r\n      sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?”\r\n\r\n      “Never, sir.”\r\n\r\n      “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\r\n\r\n      “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid\r\n      it.”\r\n\r\n      “You have a house in town, I conclude?”\r\n\r\n      Mr. Darcy bowed.\r\n\r\n      “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am\r\n      fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that\r\n      the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”\r\n\r\n      He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\r\n      disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\r\n      towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very\r\n      gallant thing, and called out to her,\r\n\r\n      “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must\r\n      allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable\r\n      partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much\r\n      beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given\r\n      it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not\r\n      unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said\r\n      with some discomposure to Sir William,\r\n\r\n      “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I\r\n      entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg\r\n      for a partner.”\r\n\r\n      Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\r\n      honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor\r\n      did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\r\n      persuasion.\r\n\r\n      “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\r\n      deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\r\n      dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am\r\n      sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.”\r\n\r\n      “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\r\n\r\n      “He is, indeed—but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\r\n      Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object\r\n      to such a partner?”\r\n\r\n      Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\r\n      injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with\r\n      some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\r\n\r\n      “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\r\n\r\n      “I should imagine not.”\r\n\r\n      “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\r\n      evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of\r\n      your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet\r\n      the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all\r\n      these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\r\n\r\n      “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\r\n      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great\r\n      pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman\r\n      can bestow.”\r\n\r\n      Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired\r\n      he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\r\n      reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,\r\n\r\n      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\r\n\r\n      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all\r\n      astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray\r\n      when am I to wish you joy?”\r\n\r\n      “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A\r\n      lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\r\n      love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be\r\n      wishing me joy.”\r\n\r\n      “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\r\n      absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,\r\n      indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with\r\n      you.”\r\n\r\n      He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\r\n      entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\r\n      her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n      Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\r\n      two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\r\n      entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and\r\n      their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,\r\n      could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been\r\n      an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\r\n      to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\r\n      settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\r\n\r\n      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\r\n      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\r\n      tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\r\n      their aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two\r\n      youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\r\n      frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\r\n      their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to\r\n      Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish\r\n      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the\r\n      country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\r\n      from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\r\n      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia\r\n      regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,\r\n      and Meryton was the headquarters.\r\n\r\n      Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most\r\n      interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their\r\n      knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings\r\n      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the\r\n      officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this\r\n      opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They\r\n      could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large\r\n      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was\r\n      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an\r\n      ensign.\r\n\r\n      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,\r\n      Mr. Bennet coolly observed,\r\n\r\n      “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\r\n      be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it\r\n      some time, but I am now convinced.”\r\n\r\n      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with\r\n      perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\r\n      Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\r\n      day, as he was going the next morning to London.\r\n\r\n      “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be\r\n      so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think\r\n      slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own,\r\n      however.”\r\n\r\n      “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of\r\n      it.”\r\n\r\n      “Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\r\n\r\n      “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\r\n      agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\r\n      particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\r\n      youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.”\r\n\r\n      “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the\r\n      sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I\r\n      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\r\n      I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,\r\n      indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,\r\n      with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I\r\n      shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked\r\n      very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his\r\n      regimentals.”\r\n\r\n      “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\r\n      Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did\r\n      when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\r\n      Clarke’s library.”\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman\r\n      with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the\r\n      servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with\r\n      pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter\r\n      read,\r\n\r\n      “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?\r\n      Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\r\n\r\n      “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\r\n\r\n      “MY DEAR FRIEND,—\r\n      “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa\r\n      and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest\r\n      of our lives, for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women\r\n      can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the\r\n      receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with\r\n      the officers.—Yours ever,\r\n\r\n      “CAROLINE BINGLEY”\r\n\r\n      “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell\r\n      us of _that_.”\r\n\r\n      “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”\r\n\r\n      “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\r\n\r\n      “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\r\n      likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”\r\n\r\n      “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure\r\n      that they would not offer to send her home.”\r\n\r\n      “Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to\r\n      Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\r\n\r\n      “I had much rather go in the coach.”\r\n\r\n      “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\r\n      They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”\r\n\r\n      “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\r\n\r\n      “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s\r\n      purpose will be answered.”\r\n\r\n      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the\r\n      horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on\r\n      horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\r\n      cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane\r\n      had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were\r\n      uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued\r\n      the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not\r\n      come back.\r\n\r\n      “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more\r\n      than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.\r\n      Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the\r\n      felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a\r\n      servant from Netherfield brought the following note for\r\n      Elizabeth:\r\n\r\n      “MY DEAREST LIZZY,—\r\n      “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to\r\n      be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends\r\n      will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also\r\n      on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should\r\n      hear of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and\r\n      headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, &amp;c.”\r\n\r\n      “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\r\n      note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\r\n      illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\r\n      was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\r\n\r\n      “Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\r\n      trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she\r\n      stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I\r\n      could have the carriage.”\r\n\r\n      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\r\n      though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\r\n      horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her\r\n      resolution.\r\n\r\n      “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such\r\n      a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when\r\n      you get there.”\r\n\r\n      “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”\r\n\r\n      “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\r\n      horses?”\r\n\r\n      “No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\r\n      nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back\r\n      by dinner.”\r\n\r\n      “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but\r\n      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\r\n      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\r\n      required.”\r\n\r\n      “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and\r\n      Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\r\n      ladies set off together.\r\n\r\n      “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we\r\n      may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”\r\n\r\n      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings\r\n      of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk\r\n      alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over\r\n      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and\r\n      finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\r\n      ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\r\n      exercise.\r\n\r\n      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\r\n      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\r\n      surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the\r\n      day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible\r\n      to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that\r\n      they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very\r\n      politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was\r\n      something better than politeness; there was good humour and\r\n      kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at\r\n      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy\r\n      which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the\r\n      occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\r\n      thinking only of his breakfast.\r\n\r\n      Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\r\n      Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\r\n      not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken\r\n      to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the\r\n      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note\r\n      how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her\r\n      entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and\r\n      when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little\r\n      beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness\r\n      she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\r\n\r\n      When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and\r\n      Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\r\n      affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary\r\n      came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\r\n      supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\r\n      endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\r\n      and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,\r\n      for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.\r\n      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other\r\n      ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\r\n      nothing to do elsewhere.\r\n\r\n      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\r\n      very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\r\n      and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\r\n      testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\r\n      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\r\n      remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully\r\n      consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint\r\n      the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n      At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\r\n      six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries\r\n      which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of\r\n      distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she\r\n      could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means\r\n      better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\r\n      times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a\r\n      bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;\r\n      and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference\r\n      towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth\r\n      to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\r\n\r\n      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\r\n      could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was\r\n      evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\r\n      prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed\r\n      she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from\r\n      any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister\r\n      scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he\r\n      was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at\r\n      cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,\r\n      had nothing to say to her.\r\n\r\n      When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\r\n      Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her\r\n      manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride\r\n      and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.\r\n      Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,\r\n\r\n      “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being\n</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ebookDF = spark.read.format(\"text\").load(\"/FileStore/data/ebook/PrideAndPrejudice.txt\")\nebookDF.show(10)\nebookDF.display()\n"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"27aa8f55-fa0f-479f-8bbc-7e743bb609f4"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"+--------------------+\n|               value|\n+--------------------+\n|The Project Guten...|\n|                    |\n|This eBook is for...|\n|most other parts ...|\n|whatsoever.

1</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in</td></tr><tr><td>      possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be</td></tr><tr><td>      on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well</td></tr><tr><td>      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is</td></tr><tr><td>      considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their</td></tr><tr><td>      daughters.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you</td></tr><tr><td>      heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and</td></tr><tr><td>      she told me all about it.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bennet made no answer.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife</td></tr><tr><td>      impatiently.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      This was invitation enough.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is</td></tr><tr><td>      taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;</td></tr><tr><td>      that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the</td></tr><tr><td>      place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before</td></tr><tr><td>      Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by</td></tr><tr><td>      the end of next week.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “What is his name?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Bingley.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Is he married or single?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;</td></tr><tr><td>      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “How so? how can it affect them?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so</td></tr><tr><td>      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of</td></tr><tr><td>      them.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Is that his design in settling here?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely</td></tr><tr><td>      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you</td></tr><tr><td>      must visit him as soon as he comes.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may</td></tr><tr><td>      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for</td></tr><tr><td>      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you</td></tr><tr><td>      the best of the party.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of</td></tr><tr><td>      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.</td></tr><tr><td>      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over</td></tr><tr><td>      thinking of her own beauty.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he</td></tr><tr><td>      comes into the neighbourhood.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it</td></tr><tr><td>      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are</td></tr><tr><td>      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you</td></tr><tr><td>      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be</td></tr><tr><td>      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be</td></tr><tr><td>      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to</td></tr><tr><td>      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he</td></tr><tr><td>      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my</td></tr><tr><td>      little Lizzy.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better</td></tr><tr><td>      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as</td></tr><tr><td>      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always</td></tr><tr><td>      giving _her_ the preference.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;</td></tr><tr><td>      “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has</td></tr><tr><td>      something more of quickness than her sisters.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?</td></tr><tr><td>      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor</td></tr><tr><td>      nerves.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.</td></tr><tr><td>      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with</td></tr><tr><td>      consideration these twenty years at least.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men</td></tr><tr><td>      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you</td></tr><tr><td>      will not visit them.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will</td></tr><tr><td>      visit them all.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,</td></tr><tr><td>      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty</td></tr><tr><td>      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his</td></tr><tr><td>      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a</td></tr><tr><td>      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain</td></tr><tr><td>      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.</td></tr><tr><td>      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its</td></tr><tr><td>      solace was visiting and news.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 2</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last</td></tr><tr><td>      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the</td></tr><tr><td>      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It</td></tr><tr><td>      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second</td></tr><tr><td>      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her</td></tr><tr><td>      with,</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her</td></tr><tr><td>      mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him</td></tr><tr><td>      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two</td></tr><tr><td>      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I</td></tr><tr><td>      have no opinion of her.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that</td></tr><tr><td>      you do not depend on her serving you.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain</td></tr><tr><td>      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little</td></tr><tr><td>      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she</td></tr><tr><td>      times them ill.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.</td></tr><tr><td>      “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “To-morrow fortnight.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come</td></tr><tr><td>      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to</td></tr><tr><td>      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and</td></tr><tr><td>      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted</td></tr><tr><td>      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is</td></tr><tr><td>      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by</td></tr><tr><td>      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else</td></tr><tr><td>      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their</td></tr><tr><td>      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,</td></tr><tr><td>      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,</td></tr><tr><td>      “Nonsense, nonsense!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.</td></tr><tr><td>      “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that</td></tr><tr><td>      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you</td></tr><tr><td>      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep</td></tr><tr><td>      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return</td></tr><tr><td>      to Mr. Bingley.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so</td></tr><tr><td>      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not</td></tr><tr><td>      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually</td></tr><tr><td>      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of</td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first</td></tr><tr><td>      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she</td></tr><tr><td>      had expected all the while.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should</td></tr><tr><td>      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to</td></tr><tr><td>      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is</td></tr><tr><td>      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and</td></tr><tr><td>      never said a word about it till now.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the</td></tr><tr><td>      raptures of his wife.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the</td></tr><tr><td>      door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends</td></tr><tr><td>      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of</td></tr><tr><td>      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new</td></tr><tr><td>      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do</td></tr><tr><td>      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare</td></tr><tr><td>      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the</td></tr><tr><td>      youngest, I’m the tallest.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he</td></tr><tr><td>      would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should</td></tr><tr><td>      ask him to dinner.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 3</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her</td></tr><tr><td>      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw</td></tr><tr><td>      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.</td></tr><tr><td>      They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,</td></tr><tr><td>      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the</td></tr><tr><td>      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the</td></tr><tr><td>      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her</td></tr><tr><td>      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with</td></tr><tr><td>      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely</td></tr><tr><td>      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next</td></tr><tr><td>      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To</td></tr><tr><td>      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;</td></tr><tr><td>      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at</td></tr><tr><td>      Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the</td></tr><tr><td>      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat</td></tr><tr><td>      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained</td></tr><tr><td>      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose</td></tr><tr><td>      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies</td></tr><tr><td>      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of</td></tr><tr><td>      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and</td></tr><tr><td>      rode a black horse.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and</td></tr><tr><td>      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do</td></tr><tr><td>      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred</td></tr><tr><td>      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,</td></tr><tr><td>      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their</td></tr><tr><td>      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could</td></tr><tr><td>      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his</td></tr><tr><td>      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be</td></tr><tr><td>      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled</td></tr><tr><td>      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a</td></tr><tr><td>      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to</td></tr><tr><td>      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with</td></tr><tr><td>      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of</td></tr><tr><td>      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,</td></tr><tr><td>      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from</td></tr><tr><td>      London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered</td></tr><tr><td>      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another</td></tr><tr><td>      young man.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant</td></tr><tr><td>      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine</td></tr><tr><td>      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon</td></tr><tr><td>      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome</td></tr><tr><td>      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general</td></tr><tr><td>      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having</td></tr><tr><td>      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine</td></tr><tr><td>      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about</td></tr><tr><td>      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned</td></tr><tr><td>      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to</td></tr><tr><td>      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his</td></tr><tr><td>      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most</td></tr><tr><td>      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be</td></tr><tr><td>      compared with his friend.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the</td></tr><tr><td>      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,</td></tr><tr><td>      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and</td></tr><tr><td>      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable</td></tr><tr><td>      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him</td></tr><tr><td>      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and</td></tr><tr><td>      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other</td></tr><tr><td>      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the</td></tr><tr><td>      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His</td></tr><tr><td>      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man</td></tr><tr><td>      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there</td></tr><tr><td>      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,</td></tr><tr><td>      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into</td></tr><tr><td>      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her</td></tr><tr><td>      daughters.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,</td></tr><tr><td>      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a</td></tr><tr><td>      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance</td></tr><tr><td>      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you</td></tr><tr><td>      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much</td></tr><tr><td>      better dance.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am</td></tr><tr><td>      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as</td></tr><tr><td>      this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and</td></tr><tr><td>      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a</td></tr><tr><td>      punishment to me to stand up with.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley,</td></tr><tr><td>      “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant</td></tr><tr><td>      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of</td></tr><tr><td>      them you see uncommonly pretty.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there</td></tr><tr><td>      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very</td></tr><tr><td>      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner</td></tr><tr><td>      to introduce you.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly</td></tr><tr><td>      said, “She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I</td></tr><tr><td>      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies</td></tr><tr><td>      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your</td></tr><tr><td>      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with</td></tr><tr><td>      me.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She</td></tr><tr><td>      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for</td></tr><tr><td>      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in</td></tr><tr><td>      anything ridiculous.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the</td></tr><tr><td>      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she</td></tr><tr><td>      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified</td></tr><tr><td>      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned</td></tr><tr><td>      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the</td></tr><tr><td>      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough</td></tr><tr><td>      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet</td></tr><tr><td>      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good</td></tr><tr><td>      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which</td></tr><tr><td>      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still</td></tr><tr><td>      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present</td></tr><tr><td>      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an</td></tr><tr><td>      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had</td></tr><tr><td>      rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be</td></tr><tr><td>      disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story</td></tr><tr><td>      to hear.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a</td></tr><tr><td>      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had</td></tr><tr><td>      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.</td></tr><tr><td>      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her</td></tr><tr><td>      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,</td></tr><tr><td>      my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only</td></tr><tr><td>      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,</td></tr><tr><td>      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;</td></tr><tr><td>      but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,</td></tr><tr><td>      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going</td></tr><tr><td>      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,</td></tr><tr><td>      and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with</td></tr><tr><td>      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth</td></tr><tr><td>      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the</td></tr><tr><td>      _Boulanger_—”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband</td></tr><tr><td>      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s</td></tr><tr><td>      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his</td></tr><tr><td>      ankle in the first dance!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively</td></tr><tr><td>      handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life</td></tr><tr><td>      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace</td></tr><tr><td>      upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any</td></tr><tr><td>      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another</td></tr><tr><td>      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of</td></tr><tr><td>      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much</td></tr><tr><td>      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid</td></tr><tr><td>      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that</td></tr><tr><td>      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,</td></tr><tr><td>      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance</td></tr><tr><td>      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one</td></tr><tr><td>      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 4</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been</td></tr><tr><td>      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her</td></tr><tr><td>      sister how very much she admired him.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,</td></tr><tr><td>      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so</td></tr><tr><td>      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man</td></tr><tr><td>      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is</td></tr><tr><td>      thereby complete.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second</td></tr><tr><td>      time. I did not expect such a compliment.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference</td></tr><tr><td>      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_</td></tr><tr><td>      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He</td></tr><tr><td>      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as</td></tr><tr><td>      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for</td></tr><tr><td>      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave</td></tr><tr><td>      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Dear Lizzy!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in</td></tr><tr><td>      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good</td></tr><tr><td>      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a</td></tr><tr><td>      human being in my life.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always</td></tr><tr><td>      speak what I think.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With</td></tr><tr><td>      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and</td></tr><tr><td>      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;—one</td></tr><tr><td>      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or</td></tr><tr><td>      design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it</td></tr><tr><td>      still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.</td></tr><tr><td>      And so, you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners</td></tr><tr><td>      are not equal to his.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when</td></tr><tr><td>      you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,</td></tr><tr><td>      and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a</td></tr><tr><td>      very charming neighbour in her.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their</td></tr><tr><td>      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in</td></tr><tr><td>      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy</td></tr><tr><td>      of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by</td></tr><tr><td>      any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve</td></tr><tr><td>      them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good</td></tr><tr><td>      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of</td></tr><tr><td>      being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.</td></tr><tr><td>      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first</td></tr><tr><td>      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand</td></tr><tr><td>      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and</td></tr><tr><td>      of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every</td></tr><tr><td>      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of</td></tr><tr><td>      others. They were of a respectable family in the north of</td></tr><tr><td>      England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories</td></tr><tr><td>      than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired</td></tr><tr><td>      by trade.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred</td></tr><tr><td>      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an</td></tr><tr><td>      estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it</td></tr><tr><td>      likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was</td></tr><tr><td>      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was</td></tr><tr><td>      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his</td></tr><tr><td>      temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at</td></tr><tr><td>      Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own;</td></tr><tr><td>      but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley</td></tr><tr><td>      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.</td></tr><tr><td>      Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less</td></tr><tr><td>      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by</td></tr><tr><td>      an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did</td></tr><tr><td>      look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the</td></tr><tr><td>      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner</td></tr><tr><td>      said in its praise, and took it immediately.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in</td></tr><tr><td>      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to</td></tr><tr><td>      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,</td></tr><tr><td>      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,</td></tr><tr><td>      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the</td></tr><tr><td>      strength of Darcy’s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and</td></tr><tr><td>      of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was</td></tr><tr><td>      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was</td></tr><tr><td>      clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and</td></tr><tr><td>      fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.</td></tr><tr><td>      In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was</td></tr><tr><td>      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually</td></tr><tr><td>      giving offence.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was</td></tr><tr><td>      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with</td></tr><tr><td>      pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been</td></tr><tr><td>      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no</td></tr><tr><td>      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as</td></tr><tr><td>      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.</td></tr><tr><td>      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom</td></tr><tr><td>      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had</td></tr><tr><td>      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either</td></tr><tr><td>      attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,</td></tr><tr><td>      but she smiled too much.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they</td></tr><tr><td>      admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,</td></tr><tr><td>      and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet</td></tr><tr><td>      was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt</td></tr><tr><td>      authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 5</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the</td></tr><tr><td>      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been</td></tr><tr><td>      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable</td></tr><tr><td>      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to</td></tr><tr><td>      the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been</td></tr><tr><td>      felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business</td></tr><tr><td>      and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting</td></tr><tr><td>      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile</td></tr><tr><td>      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he</td></tr><tr><td>      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled</td></tr><tr><td>      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the</td></tr><tr><td>      world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him</td></tr><tr><td>      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.</td></tr><tr><td>      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation</td></tr><tr><td>      at St. James’s had made him courteous.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a</td></tr><tr><td>      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The</td></tr><tr><td>      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about</td></tr><tr><td>      twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk</td></tr><tr><td>      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the</td></tr><tr><td>      assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to</td></tr><tr><td>      communicate.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with</td></tr><tr><td>      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first</td></tr><tr><td>      choice.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.</td></tr><tr><td>      To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather</td></tr><tr><td>      believe he _did_—I heard something about it—but I hardly know</td></tr><tr><td>      what—something about Mr. Robinson.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;</td></tr><tr><td>      did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he</td></tr><tr><td>      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there</td></tr><tr><td>      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he</td></tr><tr><td>      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last</td></tr><tr><td>      question—‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt, there</td></tr><tr><td>      cannot be two opinions on that point.’”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Upon my word! Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem</td></tr><tr><td>      as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,”</td></tr><tr><td>      said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as</td></tr><tr><td>      his friend, is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just _tolerable_.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his</td></tr><tr><td>      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would</td></tr><tr><td>      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last</td></tr><tr><td>      night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once</td></tr><tr><td>      opening his lips.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said</td></tr><tr><td>      Jane. “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and</td></tr><tr><td>      he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very</td></tr><tr><td>      angry at being spoke to.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much</td></tr><tr><td>      unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is</td></tr><tr><td>      remarkably agreeable.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very</td></tr><tr><td>      agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how</td></tr><tr><td>      it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare</td></tr><tr><td>      say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,</td></tr><tr><td>      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas,</td></tr><tr><td>      “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with</td></tr><tr><td>      _him_, if I were you.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with</td></tr><tr><td>      him.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as</td></tr><tr><td>      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot</td></tr><tr><td>      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,</td></tr><tr><td>      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I</td></tr><tr><td>      may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily</td></tr><tr><td>      forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of</td></tr><tr><td>      her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all</td></tr><tr><td>      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common</td></tr><tr><td>      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that</td></tr><tr><td>      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of</td></tr><tr><td>      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or</td></tr><tr><td>      imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the</td></tr><tr><td>      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without</td></tr><tr><td>      being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,</td></tr><tr><td>      vanity to what we would have others think of us.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came</td></tr><tr><td>      with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would</td></tr><tr><td>      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said</td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away</td></tr><tr><td>      your bottle directly.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare</td></tr><tr><td>      that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 6</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The</td></tr><tr><td>      visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing</td></tr><tr><td>      manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and</td></tr><tr><td>      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger</td></tr><tr><td>      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted</td></tr><tr><td>      with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this</td></tr><tr><td>      attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth</td></tr><tr><td>      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,</td></tr><tr><td>      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though</td></tr><tr><td>      their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in</td></tr><tr><td>      all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.</td></tr><tr><td>      It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire</td></tr><tr><td>      her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to</td></tr><tr><td>      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the</td></tr><tr><td>      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she</td></tr><tr><td>      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered</td></tr><tr><td>      by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength</td></tr><tr><td>      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of</td></tr><tr><td>      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the</td></tr><tr><td>      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to</td></tr><tr><td>      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a</td></tr><tr><td>      disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her</td></tr><tr><td>      affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose</td></tr><tr><td>      the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor</td></tr><tr><td>      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so</td></tr><tr><td>      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it</td></tr><tr><td>      is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely—a</td></tr><tr><td>      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us</td></tr><tr><td>      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.</td></tr><tr><td>      In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection</td></tr><tr><td>      than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may</td></tr><tr><td>      never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If</td></tr><tr><td>      _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton</td></tr><tr><td>      indeed not to discover it too.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you</td></tr><tr><td>      do.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to</td></tr><tr><td>      conceal it, he must find it out.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley</td></tr><tr><td>      and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours</td></tr><tr><td>      together; and as they always see each other in large mixed</td></tr><tr><td>      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in</td></tr><tr><td>      conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every</td></tr><tr><td>      half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is</td></tr><tr><td>      secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as</td></tr><tr><td>      much as she chooses.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is</td></tr><tr><td>      in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were</td></tr><tr><td>      determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I</td></tr><tr><td>      should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not</td></tr><tr><td>      acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the</td></tr><tr><td>      degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known</td></tr><tr><td>      him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;</td></tr><tr><td>      she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined</td></tr><tr><td>      in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make</td></tr><tr><td>      her understand his character.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she</td></tr><tr><td>      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but</td></tr><tr><td>      you must remember that four evenings have been also spent</td></tr><tr><td>      together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that</td></tr><tr><td>      they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to</td></tr><tr><td>      any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has</td></tr><tr><td>      been unfolded.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart;</td></tr><tr><td>      and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had</td></tr><tr><td>      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his</td></tr><tr><td>      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a</td></tr><tr><td>      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so</td></tr><tr><td>      well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does</td></tr><tr><td>      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to</td></tr><tr><td>      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of</td></tr><tr><td>      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the</td></tr><tr><td>      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it</td></tr><tr><td>      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming</td></tr><tr><td>      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy</td></tr><tr><td>      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at</td></tr><tr><td>      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he</td></tr><tr><td>      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it</td></tr><tr><td>      clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good</td></tr><tr><td>      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered</td></tr><tr><td>      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark</td></tr><tr><td>      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.</td></tr><tr><td>      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure</td></tr><tr><td>      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her</td></tr><tr><td>      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting</td></tr><tr><td>      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was</td></tr><tr><td>      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly</td></tr><tr><td>      unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable</td></tr><tr><td>      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance</td></tr><tr><td>      with.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards</td></tr><tr><td>      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with</td></tr><tr><td>      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William</td></tr><tr><td>      Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening</td></tr><tr><td>      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I</td></tr><tr><td>      see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do</td></tr><tr><td>      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid</td></tr><tr><td>      of him.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming</td></tr><tr><td>      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend</td></tr><tr><td>      to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly</td></tr><tr><td>      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a</td></tr><tr><td>      ball at Meryton?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady</td></tr><tr><td>      energetic.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “You are severe on us.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am</td></tr><tr><td>      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always</td></tr><tr><td>      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!

A single man of large fortune;</td></tr><tr><td>      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”</td></tr><tr><td>      “How so? how can it affect them?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so</td></tr><tr><td>      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of</td></tr><tr><td>      them.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Is that his design in settling here?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely</td></tr><tr><td>      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you</td></tr><tr><td>      must visit him as soon as he comes.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may</td></tr><tr><td>      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for</td></tr><tr><td>      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you</td></tr><tr><td>      the best of the party.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of</td></tr><tr><td>      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.</td></tr><tr><td>      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over</td></tr><tr><td>      thinking of her own beauty.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he</td></tr><tr><td>      comes into the neighbourhood.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it</td></tr><tr><td>      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are</td></tr><tr><td>      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you</td></tr><tr><td>      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be</td></tr><tr><td>      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be</td></tr><tr><td>      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to</td></tr><tr><td>      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he</td></tr><tr><td>      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my</td></tr><tr><td>      little Lizzy.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better</td></tr><tr><td>      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as</td></tr><tr><td>      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always</td></tr><tr><td>      giving _her_ the preference.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;</td></tr><tr><td>      “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has</td></tr><tr><td>      something more of quickness than her sisters.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?</td></tr><tr><td>      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor</td></tr><tr><td>      nerves.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.</td></tr><tr><td>      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with</td></tr><tr><td>      consideration these twenty years at least.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men</td></tr><tr><td>      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you</td></tr><tr><td>      will not visit them.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will</td></tr><tr><td>      visit them all.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,</td></tr><tr><td>      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty</td></tr><tr><td>      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his</td></tr><tr><td>      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a</td></tr><tr><td>      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain</td></tr><tr><td>      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.</td></tr><tr><td>      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its</td></tr><tr><td>      solace was visiting and news.</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 2</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last</td></tr><tr><td>      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the</td></tr><tr><td>      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It</td></tr><tr><td>      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second</td></tr><tr><td>      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her</td></tr><tr><td>      with,</td></tr><tr><td>      “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her</td></tr><tr><td>      mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him</td></tr><tr><td>      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two</td></tr><tr><td>      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I</td></tr><tr><td>      have no opinion of her.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that</td></tr><tr><td>      you do not depend on her serving you.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain</td></tr><tr><td>      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</td></tr><tr><td>      “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little</td></tr><tr><td>      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she</td></tr><tr><td>      times them ill.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.</td></tr><tr><td>      “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “To-morrow fortnight.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come</td></tr><tr><td>      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to</td></tr><tr><td>      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and</td></tr><tr><td>      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted</td></tr><tr><td>      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is</td></tr><tr><td>      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by</td></tr><tr><td>      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else</td></tr><tr><td>      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their</td></tr><tr><td>      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,</td></tr><tr><td>      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”</td></tr><tr><td>      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,</td></tr><tr><td>      “Nonsense, nonsense!”</td></tr><tr><td>      “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.</td></tr><tr><td>      “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that</td></tr><tr><td>      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you</td></tr><tr><td>      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep</td></tr><tr><td>      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.</td></tr><tr><td>      “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return</td></tr><tr><td>      to Mr. Bingley.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</td></tr><tr><td>      “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so</td></tr><tr><td>      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not</td></tr><tr><td>      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually</td></tr><tr><td>      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”</td></tr><tr><td>      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of</td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first</td></tr><tr><td>      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she</td></tr><tr><td>      had expected all the while.</td></tr><tr><td>      “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should</td></tr><tr><td>      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to</td></tr><tr><td>      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is</td></tr><tr><td>      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and</td></tr><tr><td>      never said a word about it till now.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the</td></tr><tr><td>      raptures of his wife.</td></tr><tr><td>      “What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the</td></tr><tr><td>      door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends</td></tr><tr><td>      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of</td></tr><tr><td>      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new</td></tr><tr><td>      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do</td></tr><tr><td>      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare</td></tr><tr><td>      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the</td></tr><tr><td>      youngest, I’m the tallest.”</td></tr><tr><td>      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he</td></tr><tr><td>      would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should</td></tr><tr><td>      ask him to dinner.</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 3</td></tr><tr><td>      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her</td></tr><tr><td>      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw</td></tr><tr><td>      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.</td></tr><tr><td>      They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,</td></tr><tr><td>      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the</td></tr><tr><td>      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the</td></tr><tr><td>      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her</td></tr><tr><td>      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with</td></tr><tr><td>      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely</td></tr><tr><td>      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next</td></tr><tr><td>      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To</td></tr><tr><td>      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;</td></tr><tr><td>      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.</td></tr><tr><td>      “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at</td></tr><tr><td>      Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the</td></tr><tr><td>      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”</td></tr><tr><td>      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat</td></tr><tr><td>      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained</td></tr><tr><td>      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose</td></tr><tr><td>      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies</td></tr><tr><td>      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of</td></tr><tr><td>      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and</td></tr><tr><td>      rode a black horse.</td></tr><tr><td>      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and</td></tr><tr><td>      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do</td></tr><tr><td>      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred</td></tr><tr><td>      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,</td></tr><tr><td>      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their</td></tr><tr><td>      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could</td></tr><tr><td>      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his</td></tr><tr><td>      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be</td></tr><tr><td>      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled</td></tr><tr><td>      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a</td></tr><tr><td>      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to</td></tr><tr><td>      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with</td></tr><tr><td>      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of</td></tr><tr><td>      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,</td></tr><tr><td>      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from</td></tr><tr><td>      London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered</td></tr><tr><td>      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another</td></tr><tr><td>      young man.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant</td></tr><tr><td>      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine</td></tr><tr><td>      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon</td></tr><tr><td>      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome</td></tr><tr><td>      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general</td></tr><tr><td>      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having</td></tr><tr><td>      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine</td></tr><tr><td>      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about</td></tr><tr><td>      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned</td></tr><tr><td>      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to</td></tr><tr><td>      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his</td></tr><tr><td>      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most</td></tr><tr><td>      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be</td></tr><tr><td>      compared with his friend.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the</td></tr><tr><td>      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,</td></tr><tr><td>      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and</td></tr><tr><td>      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable</td></tr><tr><td>      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him</td></tr><tr><td>      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and</td></tr><tr><td>      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other</td></tr><tr><td>      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the</td></tr><tr><td>      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His</td></tr><tr><td>      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man</td></tr><tr><td>      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there</td></tr><tr><td>      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,</td></tr><tr><td>      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into</td></tr><tr><td>      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her</td></tr><tr><td>      daughters.</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,</td></tr><tr><td>      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a</td></tr><tr><td>      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance</td></tr><tr><td>      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.</td></tr><tr><td>      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you</td></tr><tr><td>      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much</td></tr><tr><td>      better dance.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am</td></tr><tr><td>      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as</td></tr><tr><td>      this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and</td></tr><tr><td>      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a</td></tr><tr><td>      punishment to me to stand up with.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley,</td></tr><tr><td>      “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant</td></tr><tr><td>      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of</td></tr><tr><td>      them you see uncommonly pretty.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there</td></tr><tr><td>      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very</td></tr><tr><td>      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner</td></tr><tr><td>      to introduce you.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly</td></tr><tr><td>      said, “She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I</td></tr><tr><td>      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies</td></tr><tr><td>      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your</td></tr><tr><td>      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with</td></tr><tr><td>      me.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She</td></tr><tr><td>      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for</td></tr><tr><td>      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in</td></tr><tr><td>      anything ridiculous.</td></tr><tr><td>      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the</td></tr><tr><td>      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she</td></tr><tr><td>      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified</td></tr><tr><td>      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned</td></tr><tr><td>      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the</td></tr><tr><td>      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough</td></tr><tr><td>      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet</td></tr><tr><td>      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good</td></tr><tr><td>      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which</td></tr><tr><td>      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still</td></tr><tr><td>      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present</td></tr><tr><td>      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an</td></tr><tr><td>      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had</td></tr><tr><td>      rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be</td></tr><tr><td>      disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story</td></tr><tr><td>      to hear.</td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a</td></tr><tr><td>      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had</td></tr><tr><td>      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.</td></tr><tr><td>      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her</td></tr><tr><td>      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,</td></tr><tr><td>      my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only</td></tr><tr><td>      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,</td></tr><tr><td>      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;</td></tr><tr><td>      but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,</td></tr><tr><td>      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going</td></tr><tr><td>      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,</td></tr><tr><td>      and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with</td></tr><tr><td>      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth</td></tr><tr><td>      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the</td></tr><tr><td>      _Boulanger_—”</td></tr><tr><td>      “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband</td></tr><tr><td>      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s</td></tr><tr><td>      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his</td></tr><tr><td>      ankle in the first dance!”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively</td></tr><tr><td>      handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life</td></tr><tr><td>      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace</td></tr><tr><td>      upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”</td></tr><tr><td>      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any</td></tr><tr><td>      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another</td></tr><tr><td>      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of</td></tr><tr><td>      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</td></tr><tr><td>      “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much</td></tr><tr><td>      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid</td></tr><tr><td>      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that</td></tr><tr><td>      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,</td></tr><tr><td>      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance</td></tr><tr><td>      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one</td></tr><tr><td>      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 4</td></tr><tr><td>      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been</td></tr><tr><td>      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her</td></tr><tr><td>      sister how very much she admired him.</td></tr><tr><td>      “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,</td></tr><tr><td>      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so</td></tr><tr><td>      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”</td></tr><tr><td>      “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man</td></tr><tr><td>      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is</td></tr><tr><td>      thereby complete.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second</td></tr><tr><td>      time. I did not expect such a compliment.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference</td></tr><tr><td>      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_</td></tr><tr><td>      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He</td></tr><tr><td>      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as</td></tr><tr><td>      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for</td></tr><tr><td>      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave</td></tr><tr><td>      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Dear Lizzy!”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in</td></tr><tr><td>      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good</td></tr><tr><td>      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a</td></tr><tr><td>      human being in my life.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always</td></tr><tr><td>      speak what I think.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With</td></tr><tr><td>      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and</td></tr><tr><td>      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;—one</td></tr><tr><td>      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or</td></tr><tr><td>      design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it</td></tr><tr><td>      still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.</td></tr><tr><td>      And so, you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners</td></tr><tr><td>      are not equal to his.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when</td></tr><tr><td>      you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,</td></tr><tr><td>      and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a</td></tr><tr><td>      very charming neighbour in her.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their</td></tr><tr><td>      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in</td></tr><tr><td>      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy</td></tr><tr><td>      of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by</td></tr><tr><td>      any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve</td></tr><tr><td>      them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good</td></tr><tr><td>      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of</td></tr><tr><td>      being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.</td></tr><tr><td>      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first</td></tr><tr><td>      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand</td></tr><tr><td>      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and</td></tr><tr><td>      of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every</td></tr><tr><td>      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of</td></tr><tr><td>      others. They were of a respectable family in the north of</td></tr><tr><td>      England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories</td></tr><tr><td>      than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired</td></tr><tr><td>      by trade.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred</td></tr><tr><td>      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an</td></tr><tr><td>      estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it</td></tr><tr><td>      likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was</td></tr><tr><td>      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was</td></tr><tr><td>      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his</td></tr><tr><td>      temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at</td></tr><tr><td>      Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>      His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own;</td></tr><tr><td>      but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley</td></tr><tr><td>      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.</td></tr><tr><td>      Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less</td></tr><tr><td>      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by</td></tr><tr><td>      an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did</td></tr><tr><td>      look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the</td></tr><tr><td>      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner</td></tr><tr><td>      said in its praise, and took it immediately.</td></tr><tr><td>      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in</td></tr><tr><td>      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to</td></tr><tr><td>      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,</td></tr><tr><td>      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,</td></tr><tr><td>      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the</td></tr><tr><td>      strength of Darcy’s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and</td></tr><tr><td>      of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was</td></tr><tr><td>      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was</td></tr><tr><td>      clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and</td></tr><tr><td>      fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.</td></tr><tr><td>      In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was</td></tr><tr><td>      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually</td></tr><tr><td>      giving offence.</td></tr><tr><td>      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was</td></tr><tr><td>      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with</td></tr><tr><td>      pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been</td></tr><tr><td>      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no</td></tr><tr><td>      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as</td></tr><tr><td>      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.</td></tr><tr><td>      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom</td></tr><tr><td>      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had</td></tr><tr><td>      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either</td></tr><tr><td>      attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,</td></tr><tr><td>      but she smiled too much.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they</td></tr><tr><td>      admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,</td></tr><tr><td>      and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet</td></tr><tr><td>      was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt</td></tr><tr><td>      authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 5</td></tr><tr><td>      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the</td></tr><tr><td>      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been</td></tr><tr><td>      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable</td></tr><tr><td>      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to</td></tr><tr><td>      the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been</td></tr><tr><td>      felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business</td></tr><tr><td>      and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting</td></tr><tr><td>      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile</td></tr><tr><td>      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he</td></tr><tr><td>      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled</td></tr><tr><td>      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the</td></tr><tr><td>      world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him</td></tr><tr><td>      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.</td></tr><tr><td>      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation</td></tr><tr><td>      at St. James’s had made him courteous.</td></tr><tr><td>      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a</td></tr><tr><td>      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The</td></tr><tr><td>      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about</td></tr><tr><td>      twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.</td></tr><tr><td>      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk</td></tr><tr><td>      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the</td></tr><tr><td>      assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to</td></tr><tr><td>      communicate.</td></tr><tr><td>      “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with</td></tr><tr><td>      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first</td></tr><tr><td>      choice.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.</td></tr><tr><td>      To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather</td></tr><tr><td>      believe he _did_—I heard something about it—but I hardly know</td></tr><tr><td>      what—something about Mr. Robinson.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;</td></tr><tr><td>      did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he</td></tr><tr><td>      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there</td></tr><tr><td>      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he</td></tr><tr><td>      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last</td></tr><tr><td>      question—‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt, there</td></tr><tr><td>      cannot be two opinions on that point.’”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Upon my word! Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem</td></tr><tr><td>      as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,”</td></tr><tr><td>      said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as</td></tr><tr><td>      his friend, is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just _tolerable_.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his</td></tr><tr><td>      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would</td></tr><tr><td>      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last</td></tr><tr><td>      night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once</td></tr><tr><td>      opening his lips.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said</td></tr><tr><td>      Jane. “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and</td></tr><tr><td>      he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very</td></tr><tr><td>      angry at being spoke to.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much</td></tr><tr><td>      unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is</td></tr><tr><td>      remarkably agreeable.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very</td></tr><tr><td>      agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how</td></tr><tr><td>      it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare</td></tr><tr><td>      say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,</td></tr><tr><td>      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas,</td></tr><tr><td>      “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with</td></tr><tr><td>      _him_, if I were you.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with</td></tr><tr><td>      him.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as</td></tr><tr><td>      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot</td></tr><tr><td>      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,</td></tr><tr><td>      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I</td></tr><tr><td>      may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily</td></tr><tr><td>      forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of</td></tr><tr><td>      her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all</td></tr><tr><td>      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common</td></tr><tr><td>      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that</td></tr><tr><td>      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of</td></tr><tr><td>      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or</td></tr><tr><td>      imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the</td></tr><tr><td>      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without</td></tr><tr><td>      being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,</td></tr><tr><td>      vanity to what we would have others think of us.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came</td></tr><tr><td>      with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would</td></tr><tr><td>      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said</td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away</td></tr><tr><td>      your bottle directly.”</td></tr><tr><td>      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare</td></tr><tr><td>      that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 6</td></tr><tr><td>      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The</td></tr><tr><td>      visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing</td></tr><tr><td>      manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and</td></tr><tr><td>      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger</td></tr><tr><td>      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted</td></tr><tr><td>      with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this</td></tr><tr><td>      attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth</td></tr><tr><td>      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,</td></tr><tr><td>      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though</td></tr><tr><td>      their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in</td></tr><tr><td>      all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.</td></tr><tr><td>      It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire</td></tr><tr><td>      her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to</td></tr><tr><td>      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the</td></tr><tr><td>      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she</td></tr><tr><td>      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered</td></tr><tr><td>      by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength</td></tr><tr><td>      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of</td></tr><tr><td>      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the</td></tr><tr><td>      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.</td></tr><tr><td>      “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to</td></tr><tr><td>      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a</td></tr><tr><td>      disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her</td></tr><tr><td>      affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose</td></tr><tr><td>      the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor</td></tr><tr><td>      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so</td></tr><tr><td>      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it</td></tr><tr><td>      is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely—a</td></tr><tr><td>      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us</td></tr><tr><td>      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.</td></tr><tr><td>      In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection</td></tr><tr><td>      than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may</td></tr><tr><td>      never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If</td></tr><tr><td>      _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton</td></tr><tr><td>      indeed not to discover it too.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you</td></tr><tr><td>      do.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to</td></tr><tr><td>      conceal it, he must find it out.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley</td></tr><tr><td>      and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours</td></tr><tr><td>      together; and as they always see each other in large mixed</td></tr><tr><td>      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in</td></tr><tr><td>      conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every</td></tr><tr><td>      half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is</td></tr><tr><td>      secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as</td></tr><tr><td>      much as she chooses.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is</td></tr><tr><td>      in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were</td></tr><tr><td>      determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I</td></tr><tr><td>      should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not</td></tr><tr><td>      acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the</td></tr><tr><td>      degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known</td></tr><tr><td>      him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;</td></tr><tr><td>      she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined</td></tr><tr><td>      in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make</td></tr><tr><td>      her understand his character.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she</td></tr><tr><td>      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but</td></tr><tr><td>      you must remember that four evenings have been also spent</td></tr><tr><td>      together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that</td></tr><tr><td>      they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to</td></tr><tr><td>      any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has</td></tr><tr><td>      been unfolded.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart;</td></tr><tr><td>      and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had</td></tr><tr><td>      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his</td></tr><tr><td>      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a</td></tr><tr><td>      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so</td></tr><tr><td>      well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does</td></tr><tr><td>      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to</td></tr><tr><td>      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of</td></tr><tr><td>      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the</td></tr><tr><td>      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it</td></tr><tr><td>      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming</td></tr><tr><td>      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy</td></tr><tr><td>      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at</td></tr><tr><td>      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he</td></tr><tr><td>      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it</td></tr><tr><td>      clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good</td></tr><tr><td>      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered</td></tr><tr><td>      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark</td></tr><tr><td>      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.</td></tr><tr><td>      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure</td></tr><tr><td>      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her</td></tr><tr><td>      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting</td></tr><tr><td>      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was</td></tr><tr><td>      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly</td></tr><tr><td>      unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable</td></tr><tr><td>      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance</td></tr><tr><td>      with.</td></tr><tr><td>      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards</td></tr><tr><td>      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with</td></tr><tr><td>      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William</td></tr><tr><td>      Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.</td></tr><tr><td>      “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening</td></tr><tr><td>      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I</td></tr><tr><td>      see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do</td></tr><tr><td>      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid</td></tr><tr><td>      of him.”</td></tr><tr><td>      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming</td></tr><tr><td>      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend</td></tr><tr><td>      to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,</td></tr><tr><td>      “Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly</td></tr><tr><td>      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a</td></tr><tr><td>      ball at Meryton?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady</td></tr><tr><td>      energetic.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “You are severe on us.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am</td></tr><tr><td>      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always</td></tr><tr><td>      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my</td></tr><tr><td>      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;</td></tr><tr><td>      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who</td></tr><tr><td>      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On</td></tr><tr><td>      Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well; if it</td></tr><tr><td>      must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There</td></tr><tr><td>      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar</td></tr><tr><td>      with—‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’—and I shall keep</td></tr><tr><td>      mine to swell my song.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a</td></tr><tr><td>      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of</td></tr><tr><td>      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at</td></tr><tr><td>      the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of</td></tr><tr><td>      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge</td></tr><tr><td>      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given</td></tr><tr><td>      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and</td></tr><tr><td>      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of</td></tr><tr><td>      excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,</td></tr><tr><td>      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing</td></tr><tr><td>      half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad</td></tr><tr><td>      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the</td></tr><tr><td>      request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases,</td></tr><tr><td>      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end</td></tr><tr><td>      of the room.</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of</td></tr><tr><td>      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and</td></tr><tr><td>      was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir</td></tr><tr><td>      William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.</td></tr><tr><td>      “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!</td></tr><tr><td>      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of</td></tr><tr><td>      the first refinements of polished societies.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue</td></tr><tr><td>      amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Every savage</td></tr><tr><td>      can dance.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he</td></tr><tr><td>      continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I</td></tr><tr><td>      doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      Darcy.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the</td></tr><tr><td>      sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Never, sir.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid</td></tr><tr><td>      it.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “You have a house in town, I conclude?”</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Darcy bowed.</td></tr><tr><td>      “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am</td></tr><tr><td>      fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that</td></tr><tr><td>      the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”</td></tr><tr><td>      He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not</td></tr><tr><td>      disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving</td></tr><tr><td>      towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very</td></tr><tr><td>      gallant thing, and called out to her,</td></tr><tr><td>      “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must</td></tr><tr><td>      allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable</td></tr><tr><td>      partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much</td></tr><tr><td>      beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given</td></tr><tr><td>      it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not</td></tr><tr><td>      unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said</td></tr><tr><td>      with some discomposure to Sir William,</td></tr><tr><td>      “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I</td></tr><tr><td>      entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg</td></tr><tr><td>      for a partner.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the</td></tr><tr><td>      honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor</td></tr><tr><td>      did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at</td></tr><tr><td>      persuasion.</td></tr><tr><td>      “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to</td></tr><tr><td>      deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman</td></tr><tr><td>      dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am</td></tr><tr><td>      sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.</td></tr><tr><td>      “He is, indeed—but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss</td></tr><tr><td>      Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object</td></tr><tr><td>      to such a partner?”</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not</td></tr><tr><td>      injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with</td></tr><tr><td>      some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,</td></tr><tr><td>      “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I should imagine not.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many</td></tr><tr><td>      evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of</td></tr><tr><td>      your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet</td></tr><tr><td>      the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all</td></tr><tr><td>      these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more</td></tr><tr><td>      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great</td></tr><tr><td>      pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman</td></tr><tr><td>      can bestow.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired</td></tr><tr><td>      he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such</td></tr><tr><td>      reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,</td></tr><tr><td>      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all</td></tr><tr><td>      astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray</td></tr><tr><td>      when am I to wish you joy?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A</td></tr><tr><td>      lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to</td></tr><tr><td>      love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be</td></tr><tr><td>      wishing me joy.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as</td></tr><tr><td>      absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,</td></tr><tr><td>      indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with</td></tr><tr><td>      you.”</td></tr><tr><td>      He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to</td></tr><tr><td>      entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced</td></tr><tr><td>      her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.</td></tr><tr><td>Chapter 7</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of</td></tr><tr><td>      two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was</td></tr><tr><td>      entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and</td></tr><tr><td>      their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,</td></tr><tr><td>      could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been</td></tr><tr><td>      an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.</td></tr><tr><td>      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk</td></tr><tr><td>      to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother</td></tr><tr><td>      settled in London in a respectable line of trade.</td></tr><tr><td>      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most</td></tr><tr><td>      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually</td></tr><tr><td>      tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to</td></tr><tr><td>      their aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two</td></tr><tr><td>      youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly</td></tr><tr><td>      frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than</td></tr><tr><td>      their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to</td></tr><tr><td>      Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish</td></tr><tr><td>      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the</td></tr><tr><td>      country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some</td></tr><tr><td>      from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both</td></tr><tr><td>      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia</td></tr><tr><td>      regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,</td></tr><tr><td>      and Meryton was the headquarters.</td></tr><tr><td>      Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most</td></tr><tr><td>      interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their</td></tr><tr><td>      knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings</td></tr><tr><td>      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the</td></tr><tr><td>      officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this</td></tr><tr><td>      opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They</td></tr><tr><td>      could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large</td></tr><tr><td>      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was</td></tr><tr><td>      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an</td></tr><tr><td>      ensign.</td></tr><tr><td>      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,</td></tr><tr><td>      Mr. Bennet coolly observed,</td></tr><tr><td>      “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must</td></tr><tr><td>      be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it</td></tr><tr><td>      some time, but I am now convinced.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with</td></tr><tr><td>      perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of</td></tr><tr><td>      Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the</td></tr><tr><td>      day, as he was going the next morning to London.</td></tr><tr><td>      “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be</td></tr><tr><td>      so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think</td></tr><tr><td>      slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own,</td></tr><tr><td>      however.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of</td></tr><tr><td>      it.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not</td></tr><tr><td>      agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every</td></tr><tr><td>      particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two</td></tr><tr><td>      youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the</td></tr><tr><td>      sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I</td></tr><tr><td>      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.</td></tr><tr><td>      I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,</td></tr><tr><td>      indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,</td></tr><tr><td>      with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I</td></tr><tr><td>      shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked</td></tr><tr><td>      very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his</td></tr><tr><td>      regimentals.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and</td></tr><tr><td>      Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did</td></tr><tr><td>      when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in</td></tr><tr><td>      Clarke’s library.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman</td></tr><tr><td>      with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the</td></tr><tr><td>      servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with</td></tr><tr><td>      pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter</td></tr><tr><td>      read,</td></tr><tr><td>      “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?</td></tr><tr><td>      Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.</td></tr><tr><td>      “MY DEAR FRIEND,—</td></tr><tr><td>      “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa</td></tr><tr><td>      and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest</td></tr><tr><td>      of our lives, for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women</td></tr><tr><td>      can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the</td></tr><tr><td>      receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with</td></tr><tr><td>      the officers.—Yours ever,</td></tr><tr><td>      “CAROLINE BINGLEY”</td></tr><tr><td>      “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell</td></tr><tr><td>      us of _that_.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.</td></tr><tr><td>      “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems</td></tr><tr><td>      likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure</td></tr><tr><td>      that they would not offer to send her home.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to</td></tr><tr><td>      Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I had much rather go in the coach.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.</td></tr><tr><td>      They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s</td></tr><tr><td>      purpose will be answered.”</td></tr><tr><td>      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the</td></tr><tr><td>      horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on</td></tr><tr><td>      horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many</td></tr><tr><td>      cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane</td></tr><tr><td>      had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were</td></tr><tr><td>      uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued</td></tr><tr><td>      the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not</td></tr><tr><td>      come back.</td></tr><tr><td>      “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more</td></tr><tr><td>      than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.</td></tr><tr><td>      Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the</td></tr><tr><td>      felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a</td></tr><tr><td>      servant from Netherfield brought the following note for</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth:</td></tr><tr><td>      “MY DEAREST LIZZY,—</td></tr><tr><td>      “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to</td></tr><tr><td>      be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends</td></tr><tr><td>      will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also</td></tr><tr><td>      on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should</td></tr><tr><td>      hear of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and</td></tr><tr><td>      headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, &c.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the</td></tr><tr><td>      note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of</td></tr><tr><td>      illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it</td></tr><tr><td>      was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little</td></tr><tr><td>      trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she</td></tr><tr><td>      stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I</td></tr><tr><td>      could have the carriage.”</td></tr><tr><td>      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,</td></tr><tr><td>      though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no</td></tr><tr><td>      horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her</td></tr><tr><td>      resolution.</td></tr><tr><td>      “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such</td></tr><tr><td>      a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when</td></tr><tr><td>      you get there.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the</td></tr><tr><td>      horses?”</td></tr><tr><td>      “No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is</td></tr><tr><td>      nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back</td></tr><tr><td>      by dinner.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but</td></tr><tr><td>      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my</td></tr><tr><td>      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is</td></tr><tr><td>      required.”</td></tr><tr><td>      “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and</td></tr><tr><td>      Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young</td></tr><tr><td>      ladies set off together.</td></tr><tr><td>      “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we</td></tr><tr><td>      may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”</td></tr><tr><td>      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings</td></tr><tr><td>      of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk</td></tr><tr><td>      alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over</td></tr><tr><td>      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and</td></tr><tr><td>      finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary</td></tr><tr><td>      ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of</td></tr><tr><td>      exercise.</td></tr><tr><td>      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were</td></tr><tr><td>      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of</td></tr><tr><td>      surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the</td></tr><tr><td>      day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible</td></tr><tr><td>      to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that</td></tr><tr><td>      they held her in contempt for it.

1</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in</td></tr><tr><td>      possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be</td></tr><tr><td>      on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well</td></tr><tr><td>      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is</td></tr><tr><td>      considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their</td></tr><tr><td>      daughters.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “my dear mr. bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you</td></tr><tr><td>      heard that netherfield park is let at last?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bennet replied that he had not.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “but it is,” returned she; “for mrs. long has just been here, and</td></tr><tr><td>      she told me all about it.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bennet made no answer.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife</td></tr><tr><td>      impatiently.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      this was invitation enough.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is</td></tr><tr><td>      taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england;</td></tr><tr><td>      that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the</td></tr><tr><td>      place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      morris immediately; that he is to take possession before</td></tr><tr><td>      michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by</td></tr><tr><td>      the end of next week.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “what is his name?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “bingley.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “is he married or single?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “oh! single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune;</td></tr><tr><td>      four or five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “how so? how can it affect them?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “my dear mr. bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so</td></tr><tr><td>      tiresome! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of</td></tr><tr><td>      them.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “is that his design in settling here?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “design! nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely</td></tr><tr><td>      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you</td></tr><tr><td>      must visit him as soon as he comes.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go, or you may</td></tr><tr><td>      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for</td></tr><tr><td>      as you are as handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you</td></tr><tr><td>      the best of the party.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “my dear, you flatter me. i certainly _have_ had my share of</td></tr><tr><td>      beauty, but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.</td></tr><tr><td>      when a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over</td></tr><tr><td>      thinking of her own beauty.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he</td></tr><tr><td>      comes into the neighbourhood.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “it is more than i engage for, i assure you.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it</td></tr><tr><td>      would be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are</td></tr><tr><td>      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you</td></tr><tr><td>      know, they visit no newcomers. indeed you must go, for it will be</td></tr><tr><td>      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “you are over scrupulous, surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be</td></tr><tr><td>      very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to</td></tr><tr><td>      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he</td></tr><tr><td>      chooses of the girls; though i must throw in a good word for my</td></tr><tr><td>      little lizzy.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better</td></tr><tr><td>      than the others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as</td></tr><tr><td>      jane, nor half so good-humoured as lydia. but you are always</td></tr><tr><td>      giving _her_ the preference.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “they have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;</td></tr><tr><td>      “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has</td></tr><tr><td>      something more of quickness than her sisters.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?</td></tr><tr><td>      you take delight in vexing me. you have no compassion on my poor</td></tr><tr><td>      nerves.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “you mistake me, my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves.</td></tr><tr><td>      they are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with</td></tr><tr><td>      consideration these twenty years at least.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “ah, you do not know what i suffer.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men</td></tr><tr><td>      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you</td></tr><tr><td>      will not visit them.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will</td></tr><tr><td>      visit them all.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,</td></tr><tr><td>      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty</td></tr><tr><td>      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his</td></tr><tr><td>      character. _her_ mind was less difficult to develop. she was a</td></tr><tr><td>      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain</td></tr><tr><td>      temper. when she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.</td></tr><tr><td>      the business of her life was to get her daughters married; its</td></tr><tr><td>      solace was visiting and news.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>chapter 2</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      bingley. he had always intended to visit him, though to the last</td></tr><tr><td>      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the</td></tr><tr><td>      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. it</td></tr><tr><td>      was then disclosed in the following manner. observing his second</td></tr><tr><td>      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her</td></tr><tr><td>      with,</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “we are not in a way to know _what_ mr. bingley likes,” said her</td></tr><tr><td>      mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “but you forget, mamma,” said elizabeth, “that we shall meet him</td></tr><tr><td>      at the assemblies, and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has two</td></tr><tr><td>      nieces of her own. she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i</td></tr><tr><td>      have no opinion of her.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “no more have i,” said mr. bennet; “and i am glad to find that</td></tr><tr><td>      you do not depend on her serving you.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain</td></tr><tr><td>      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “don’t keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven’s sake! have a little</td></tr><tr><td>      compassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she</td></tr><tr><td>      times them ill.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i do not cough for my own amusement,” replied kitty fretfully.</td></tr><tr><td>      “when is your next ball to be, lizzy?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “to-morrow fortnight.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and mrs. long does not come</td></tr><tr><td>      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to</td></tr><tr><td>      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and</td></tr><tr><td>      introduce mr. bingley to _her_.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted</td></tr><tr><td>      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i honour your circumspection. a fortnight’s acquaintance is</td></tr><tr><td>      certainly very little. one cannot know what a man really is by</td></tr><tr><td>      the end of a fortnight. but if _we_ do not venture somebody else</td></tr><tr><td>      will; and after all, mrs. long and her nieces must stand their</td></tr><tr><td>      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,</td></tr><tr><td>      if you decline the office, i will take it on myself.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only,</td></tr><tr><td>      “nonsense, nonsense!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.</td></tr><tr><td>      “do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that</td></tr><tr><td>      is laid on them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you</td></tr><tr><td>      _there_. what say you, mary? for you are a young lady of deep</td></tr><tr><td>      reflection, i know, and read great books and make extracts.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “while mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return</td></tr><tr><td>      to mr. bingley.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i am sick of mr. bingley,” cried his wife.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so</td></tr><tr><td>      before? if i had known as much this morning, i certainly would not</td></tr><tr><td>      have called on him. it is very unlucky; but as i have actually</td></tr><tr><td>      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of</td></tr><tr><td>      mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first</td></tr><tr><td>      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she</td></tr><tr><td>      had expected all the while.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i should</td></tr><tr><td>      persuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well to</td></tr><tr><td>      neglect such an acquaintance. well, how pleased i am! and it is</td></tr><tr><td>      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and</td></tr><tr><td>      never said a word about it till now.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the</td></tr><tr><td>      raptures of his wife.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “what an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the</td></tr><tr><td>      door was shut. “i do not know how you will ever make him amends</td></tr><tr><td>      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. at our time of</td></tr><tr><td>      life, it is not so pleasant, i can tell you, to be making new</td></tr><tr><td>      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do</td></tr><tr><td>      anything. lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, i dare</td></tr><tr><td>      say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “oh!” said lydia stoutly, “i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the</td></tr><tr><td>      youngest, i’m the tallest.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he</td></tr><tr><td>      would return mr. bennet’s visit, and determining when they should</td></tr><tr><td>      ask him to dinner.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>chapter 3</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      not all that mrs. bennet, however, with the assistance of her</td></tr><tr><td>      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw</td></tr><tr><td>      from her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley.</td></tr><tr><td>      they attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,</td></tr><tr><td>      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the</td></tr><tr><td>      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the</td></tr><tr><td>      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, lady lucas. her</td></tr><tr><td>      report was highly favourable. sir william had been delighted with</td></tr><tr><td>      him. he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely</td></tr><tr><td>      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next</td></tr><tr><td>      assembly with a large party. nothing could be more delightful! to</td></tr><tr><td>      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;</td></tr><tr><td>      and very lively hopes of mr. bingley’s heart were entertained.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at</td></tr><tr><td>      netherfield,” said mrs. bennet to her husband, “and all the</td></tr><tr><td>      others equally well married, i shall have nothing to wish for.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet’s visit, and sat</td></tr><tr><td>      about ten minutes with him in his library. he had entertained</td></tr><tr><td>      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose</td></tr><tr><td>      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. the ladies</td></tr><tr><td>      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of</td></tr><tr><td>      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and</td></tr><tr><td>      rode a black horse.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and</td></tr><tr><td>      already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do</td></tr><tr><td>      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred</td></tr><tr><td>      it all. mr. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,</td></tr><tr><td>      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their</td></tr><tr><td>      invitation, etc. mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted. she could</td></tr><tr><td>      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his</td></tr><tr><td>      arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be</td></tr><tr><td>      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled</td></tr><tr><td>      at netherfield as he ought to be. lady lucas quieted her fears a</td></tr><tr><td>      little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to</td></tr><tr><td>      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that</td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with</td></tr><tr><td>      him to the assembly. the girls grieved over such a number of</td></tr><tr><td>      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,</td></tr><tr><td>      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from</td></tr><tr><td>      london, his five sisters and a cousin. and when the party entered</td></tr><tr><td>      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another</td></tr><tr><td>      young man.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant</td></tr><tr><td>      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. his sisters were fine</td></tr><tr><td>      women, with an air of decided fashion. his brother-in-law, mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon</td></tr><tr><td>      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome</td></tr><tr><td>      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general</td></tr><tr><td>      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having</td></tr><tr><td>      ten thousand a year. the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine</td></tr><tr><td>      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than</td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about</td></tr><tr><td>      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned</td></tr><tr><td>      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to</td></tr><tr><td>      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his</td></tr><tr><td>      large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most</td></tr><tr><td>      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be</td></tr><tr><td>      compared with his friend.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the</td></tr><tr><td>      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,</td></tr><tr><td>      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and</td></tr><tr><td>      talked of giving one himself at netherfield. such amiable</td></tr><tr><td>      qualities must speak for themselves. what a contrast between him</td></tr><tr><td>      and his friend! mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and</td></tr><tr><td>      once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other</td></tr><tr><td>      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the</td></tr><tr><td>      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. his</td></tr><tr><td>      character was decided. he was the proudest, most disagreeable man</td></tr><tr><td>      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there</td></tr><tr><td>      again. amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet,</td></tr><tr><td>      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into</td></tr><tr><td>      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her</td></tr><tr><td>      daughters.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,</td></tr><tr><td>      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr.</td></tr><tr><td>      darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a</td></tr><tr><td>      conversation between him and mr. bingley, who came from the dance</td></tr><tr><td>      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “come, darcy,” said he, “i must have you dance. i hate to see you</td></tr><tr><td>      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much</td></tr><tr><td>      better dance.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it, unless i am</td></tr><tr><td>      particularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as</td></tr><tr><td>      this, it would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged, and</td></tr><tr><td>      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a</td></tr><tr><td>      punishment to me to stand up with.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried bingley,</td></tr><tr><td>      “for a kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant</td></tr><tr><td>      girls in my life as i have this evening; and there are several of</td></tr><tr><td>      them you see uncommonly pretty.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said</td></tr><tr><td>      mr. darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “oh! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there</td></tr><tr><td>      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very</td></tr><tr><td>      pretty, and i dare say very agreeable. do let me ask my partner</td></tr><tr><td>      to introduce you.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at</td></tr><tr><td>      elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly</td></tr><tr><td>      said, “she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i</td></tr><tr><td>      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies</td></tr><tr><td>      who are slighted by other men. you had better return to your</td></tr><tr><td>      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with</td></tr><tr><td>      me.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off; and</td></tr><tr><td>      elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. she</td></tr><tr><td>      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for</td></tr><tr><td>      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in</td></tr><tr><td>      anything ridiculous.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.</td></tr><tr><td>      mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the</td></tr><tr><td>      netherfield party. mr. bingley had danced with her twice, and she</td></tr><tr><td>      had been distinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified</td></tr><tr><td>      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.</td></tr><tr><td>      elizabeth felt jane’s pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned</td></tr><tr><td>      to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the</td></tr><tr><td>      neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough</td></tr><tr><td>      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet</td></tr><tr><td>      learnt to care for at a ball. they returned, therefore, in good</td></tr><tr><td>      spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which</td></tr><tr><td>      they were the principal inhabitants. they found mr. bennet still</td></tr><tr><td>      up. with a book he was regardless of time; and on the present</td></tr><tr><td>      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an</td></tr><tr><td>      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. he had</td></tr><tr><td>      rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be</td></tr><tr><td>      disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story</td></tr><tr><td>      to hear.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “oh, my dear mr. bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a</td></tr><tr><td>      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. i wish you had</td></tr><tr><td>      been there. jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.</td></tr><tr><td>      everybody said how well she looked; and mr. bingley thought her</td></tr><tr><td>      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. only think of _that_,</td></tr><tr><td>      my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only</td></tr><tr><td>      creature in the room that he asked a second time. first of all,</td></tr><tr><td>      he asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand up with her;</td></tr><tr><td>      but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,</td></tr><tr><td>      you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going</td></tr><tr><td>      down the dance. so he enquired who she was, and got introduced,</td></tr><tr><td>      and asked her for the two next. then, the two third he danced with</td></tr><tr><td>      miss king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth</td></tr><tr><td>      with jane again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the</td></tr><tr><td>      _boulanger_—”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “if he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband</td></tr><tr><td>      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! for god’s</td></tr><tr><td>      sake, say no more of his partners. oh that he had sprained his</td></tr><tr><td>      ankle in the first dance!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “oh! my dear,” continued mrs. bennet, “i am quite delighted with him. he is so excessively</td></tr><tr><td>      handsome! and his sisters are charming women. i never in my life</td></tr><tr><td>      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the lace</td></tr><tr><td>      upon mrs. hurst’s gown—”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      here she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested against any</td></tr><tr><td>      description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another</td></tr><tr><td>      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of</td></tr><tr><td>      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “but i can assure you,” she added, “that lizzy does not lose much</td></tr><tr><td>      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid</td></tr><tr><td>      man, not at all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited that</td></tr><tr><td>      there was no enduring him! he walked here, and he walked there,</td></tr><tr><td>      fancying himself so very great! not handsome enough to dance</td></tr><tr><td>      with! i wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one</td></tr><tr><td>      of your set-downs. i quite detest the man.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>chapter 4</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been</td></tr><tr><td>      cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to her</td></tr><tr><td>      sister how very much she admired him.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “he is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,</td></tr><tr><td>      good-humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!—so</td></tr><tr><td>      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “he is also handsome,” replied elizabeth, “which a young man</td></tr><tr><td>      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. his character is</td></tr><tr><td>      thereby complete.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second</td></tr><tr><td>      time. i did not expect such a compliment.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “did not you? _i_ did for you. but that is one great difference</td></tr><tr><td>      between us. compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_</td></tr><tr><td>      never. what could be more natural than his asking you again? he</td></tr><tr><td>      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as</td></tr><tr><td>      every other woman in the room. no thanks to his gallantry for</td></tr><tr><td>      that. well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave</td></tr><tr><td>      to like him. you have liked many a stupider person.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “dear lizzy!”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in</td></tr><tr><td>      general. you never see a fault in anybody. all the world are good</td></tr><tr><td>      and agreeable in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of a</td></tr><tr><td>      human being in my life.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but i always</td></tr><tr><td>      speak what i think.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. with</td></tr><tr><td>      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and</td></tr><tr><td>      nonsense of others! affectation of candour is common enough;—one</td></tr><tr><td>      meets with it everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or</td></tr><tr><td>      design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it</td></tr><tr><td>      still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.</td></tr><tr><td>      and so, you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? their manners</td></tr><tr><td>      are not equal to his.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “certainly not; at first. but they are very pleasing women when</td></tr><tr><td>      you converse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother,</td></tr><tr><td>      and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a</td></tr><tr><td>      very charming neighbour in her.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their</td></tr><tr><td>      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in</td></tr><tr><td>      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy</td></tr><tr><td>      of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by</td></tr><tr><td>      any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve</td></tr><tr><td>      them. they were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good</td></tr><tr><td>      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of</td></tr><tr><td>      being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.</td></tr><tr><td>      they were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first</td></tr><tr><td>      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand</td></tr><tr><td>      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and</td></tr><tr><td>      of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every</td></tr><tr><td>      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of</td></tr><tr><td>      others. they were of a respectable family in the north of</td></tr><tr><td>      england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories</td></tr><tr><td>      than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired</td></tr><tr><td>      by trade.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred</td></tr><tr><td>      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an</td></tr><tr><td>      estate, but did not live to do it. mr. bingley intended it</td></tr><tr><td>      likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was</td></tr><tr><td>      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was</td></tr><tr><td>      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his</td></tr><tr><td>      temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at</td></tr><tr><td>      netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own;</td></tr><tr><td>      but though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley</td></tr><tr><td>      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was mrs.</td></tr><tr><td>      hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less</td></tr><tr><td>      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.</td></tr><tr><td>      mr. bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by</td></tr><tr><td>      an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house. he did</td></tr><tr><td>      look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the</td></tr><tr><td>      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner</td></tr><tr><td>      said in its praise, and took it immediately.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in</td></tr><tr><td>      spite of great opposition of character. bingley was endeared to</td></tr><tr><td>      darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,</td></tr><tr><td>      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,</td></tr><tr><td>      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. on the</td></tr><tr><td>      strength of darcy’s regard bingley had the firmest reliance, and</td></tr><tr><td>      of his judgment the highest opinion. in understanding, darcy was</td></tr><tr><td>      the superior. bingley was by no means deficient, but darcy was</td></tr><tr><td>      clever. he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and</td></tr><tr><td>      fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.</td></tr><tr><td>      in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley was</td></tr><tr><td>      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually</td></tr><tr><td>      giving offence.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was</td></tr><tr><td>      sufficiently characteristic. bingley had never met with</td></tr><tr><td>      pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been</td></tr><tr><td>      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no</td></tr><tr><td>      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as</td></tr><tr><td>      to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.</td></tr><tr><td>      darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom</td></tr><tr><td>      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had</td></tr><tr><td>      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either</td></tr><tr><td>      attention or pleasure. miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,</td></tr><tr><td>      but she smiled too much.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they</td></tr><tr><td>      admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,</td></tr><tr><td>      and one whom they should not object to know more of. miss bennet</td></tr><tr><td>      was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt</td></tr><tr><td>      authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>chapter 5</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the</td></tr><tr><td>      bennets were particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been</td></tr><tr><td>      formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made a tolerable</td></tr><tr><td>      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to</td></tr><tr><td>      the king during his mayoralty. the distinction had perhaps been</td></tr><tr><td>      felt too strongly. it had given him a disgust to his business</td></tr><tr><td>      and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting</td></tr><tr><td>      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile</td></tr><tr><td>      from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he</td></tr><tr><td>      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled</td></tr><tr><td>      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the</td></tr><tr><td>      world. for, though elated by his rank, it did not render him</td></tr><tr><td>      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.</td></tr><tr><td>      by nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation</td></tr><tr><td>      at st. james’s had made him courteous.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a</td></tr><tr><td>      valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had several children. the</td></tr><tr><td>      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about</td></tr><tr><td>      twenty-seven, was elizabeth’s intimate friend.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk</td></tr><tr><td>      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the</td></tr><tr><td>      assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to</td></tr><tr><td>      communicate.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “_you_ began the evening well, charlotte,” said mrs. bennet with</td></tr><tr><td>      civil self-command to miss lucas. “_you_ were mr. bingley’s first</td></tr><tr><td>      choice.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “oh! you mean jane, i suppose, because he danced with her twice.</td></tr><tr><td>      to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her—indeed i rather</td></tr><tr><td>      believe he _did_—i heard something about it—but i hardly know</td></tr><tr><td>      what—something about mr. robinson.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson;</td></tr><tr><td>      did not i mention it to you? mr. robinson’s asking him how he</td></tr><tr><td>      liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there</td></tr><tr><td>      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he</td></tr><tr><td>      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last</td></tr><tr><td>      question—‘oh! the eldest miss bennet, beyond a doubt, there</td></tr><tr><td>      cannot be two opinions on that point.’”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “upon my word! well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem</td></tr><tr><td>      as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza,”</td></tr><tr><td>      said charlotte. “mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as</td></tr><tr><td>      his friend, is he?—poor eliza!—to be only just _tolerable_.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i beg you would not put it into lizzy’s head to be vexed by his</td></tr><tr><td>      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would</td></tr><tr><td>      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. long told me last</td></tr><tr><td>      night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once</td></tr><tr><td>      opening his lips.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said</td></tr><tr><td>      jane. “i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “aye—because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and</td></tr><tr><td>      he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very</td></tr><tr><td>      angry at being spoke to.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “miss bingley told me,” said jane, “that he never speaks much</td></tr><tr><td>      unless among his intimate acquaintance. with _them_ he is</td></tr><tr><td>      remarkably agreeable.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i do not believe a word of it, my dear. if he had been so very</td></tr><tr><td>      agreeable, he would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guess how</td></tr><tr><td>      it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and i dare</td></tr><tr><td>      say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage,</td></tr><tr><td>      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long,” said miss lucas,</td></tr><tr><td>      “but i wish he had danced with eliza.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “another time, lizzy,” said her mother, “i would not dance with</td></tr><tr><td>      _him_, if i were you.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “i believe, ma’am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with</td></tr><tr><td>      him.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “his pride,” said miss lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as</td></tr><tr><td>      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. one cannot</td></tr><tr><td>      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,</td></tr><tr><td>      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. if i</td></tr><tr><td>      may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “that is very true,” replied elizabeth, “and i could easily</td></tr><tr><td>      forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “pride,” observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of</td></tr><tr><td>      her reflections, “is a very common failing, i believe. by all</td></tr><tr><td>      that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very common</td></tr><tr><td>      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that</td></tr><tr><td>      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of</td></tr><tr><td>      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or</td></tr><tr><td>      imaginary. vanity and pride are different things, though the</td></tr><tr><td>      words are often used synonymously. a person may be proud without</td></tr><tr><td>      being vain. pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,</td></tr><tr><td>      vanity to what we would have others think of us.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “if i were as rich as mr. darcy,” cried a young lucas, who came</td></tr><tr><td>      with his sisters, “i should not care how proud i was. i would</td></tr><tr><td>      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said</td></tr><tr><td>      mrs. bennet; “and if i were to see you at it, i should take away</td></tr><tr><td>      your bottle directly.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare</td></tr><tr><td>      that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>chapter 6</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the</td></tr><tr><td>      visit was returned in due form. miss bennet’s pleasing</td></tr><tr><td>      manners grew on the goodwill of mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and</td></tr><tr><td>      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger</td></tr><tr><td>      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted</td></tr><tr><td>      with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. by jane this</td></tr><tr><td>      attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth</td></tr><tr><td>      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,</td></tr><tr><td>      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though</td></tr><tr><td>      their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in</td></tr><tr><td>      all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.</td></tr><tr><td>      it was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire</td></tr><tr><td>      her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to</td></tr><tr><td>      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the</td></tr><tr><td>      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she</td></tr><tr><td>      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered</td></tr><tr><td>      by the world in general, since jane united with great strength</td></tr><tr><td>      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of</td></tr><tr><td>      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the</td></tr><tr><td>      impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “it may perhaps be pleasant,” replied charlotte, “to be able to</td></tr><tr><td>      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a</td></tr><tr><td>      disadvantage to be so very guarded. if a woman conceals her</td></tr><tr><td>      affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose</td></tr><tr><td>      the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor</td></tr><tr><td>      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. there is so</td></tr><tr><td>      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it</td></tr><tr><td>      is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all _begin_ freely—a</td></tr><tr><td>      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us</td></tr><tr><td>      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.</td></tr><tr><td>      in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection</td></tr><tr><td>      than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may</td></tr><tr><td>      never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. if</td></tr><tr><td>      _i_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton</td></tr><tr><td>      indeed not to discover it too.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “remember, eliza, that he does not know jane’s disposition as you</td></tr><tr><td>      do.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to</td></tr><tr><td>      conceal it, he must find it out.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. but though bingley</td></tr><tr><td>      and jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours</td></tr><tr><td>      together; and as they always see each other in large mixed</td></tr><tr><td>      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in</td></tr><tr><td>      conversing together. jane should therefore make the most of every</td></tr><tr><td>      half-hour in which she can command his attention. when she is</td></tr><tr><td>      secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as</td></tr><tr><td>      much as she chooses.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “your plan is a good one,” replied elizabeth, “where nothing is</td></tr><tr><td>      in question but the desire of being well married; and if i were</td></tr><tr><td>      determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i</td></tr><tr><td>      should adopt it. but these are not jane’s feelings; she is not</td></tr><tr><td>      acting by design. as yet, she cannot even be certain of the</td></tr><tr><td>      degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. she has known</td></tr><tr><td>      him only a fortnight. she danced four dances with him at meryton;</td></tr><tr><td>      she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined</td></tr><tr><td>      in company with him four times. this is not quite enough to make</td></tr><tr><td>      her understand his character.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “not as you represent it. had she merely _dined_ with him, she</td></tr><tr><td>      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but</td></tr><tr><td>      you must remember that four evenings have been also spent</td></tr><tr><td>      together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that</td></tr><tr><td>      they both like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to</td></tr><tr><td>      any other leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has</td></tr><tr><td>      been unfolded.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “well,” said charlotte, “i wish jane success with all my heart;</td></tr><tr><td>      and if she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had</td></tr><tr><td>      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his</td></tr><tr><td>      character for a twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely a</td></tr><tr><td>      matter of chance. if the dispositions of the parties are ever so</td></tr><tr><td>      well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does</td></tr><tr><td>      not advance their felicity in the least. they always continue to</td></tr><tr><td>      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of</td></tr><tr><td>      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the</td></tr><tr><td>      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound. you know it</td></tr><tr><td>      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      occupied in observing mr. bingley’s attentions to her sister,</td></tr><tr><td>      elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming</td></tr><tr><td>      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcy</td></tr><tr><td>      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at</td></tr><tr><td>      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he</td></tr><tr><td>      looked at her only to criticise. but no sooner had he made it</td></tr><tr><td>      clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good</td></tr><tr><td>      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered</td></tr><tr><td>      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark</td></tr><tr><td>      eyes. to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.</td></tr><tr><td>      though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure</td></tr><tr><td>      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her</td></tr><tr><td>      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting</td></tr><tr><td>      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was</td></tr><tr><td>      caught by their easy playfulness. of this she was perfectly</td></tr><tr><td>      unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable</td></tr><tr><td>      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance</td></tr><tr><td>      with.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards</td></tr><tr><td>      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with</td></tr><tr><td>      others. his doing so drew her notice. it was at sir william</td></tr><tr><td>      lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “what does mr. darcy mean,” said she to charlotte, “by listening</td></tr><tr><td>      to my conversation with colonel forster?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i</td></tr><tr><td>      see what he is about. he has a very satirical eye, and if i do</td></tr><tr><td>      not begin by being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid</td></tr><tr><td>      of him.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming</td></tr><tr><td>      to have any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend</td></tr><tr><td>      to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking</td></tr><tr><td>      elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “did not you think, mr. darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly</td></tr><tr><td>      well just now, when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a</td></tr><tr><td>      ball at meryton?”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “with great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady</td></tr><tr><td>      energetic.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “you are severe on us.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “it will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said miss lucas. “i am</td></tr><tr><td>      going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      “you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always</td></tr><tr><td>      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! if my</td></tr><tr><td>      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;</td></tr><tr><td>      but as it is, i would really rather not sit down before those who</td></tr><tr><td>      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” on</td></tr><tr><td>      miss lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “very well; if it</td></tr><tr><td>      must be so, it must.” and gravely glancing at mr. darcy, “there</td></tr><tr><td>      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar</td></tr><tr><td>      with—‘keep your breath to cool your porridge,’—and i shall keep</td></tr><tr><td>      mine to swell my song.”</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. after a</td></tr><tr><td>      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of</td></tr><tr><td>      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at</td></tr><tr><td>      the instrument by her sister mary, who having, in consequence of</td></tr><tr><td>      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge</td></tr><tr><td>      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>      mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given</td></tr><tr><td>      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and</td></tr><tr><td>      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of</td></tr><tr><td>      excellence than she had reached. elizabeth, easy and unaffected,</td></tr><tr><td>      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing</td></tr><tr><td>      half so well; and mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad</td></tr><tr><td>      to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs, at the</td></tr><tr><td>      request of her younger sisters, who with some of the lucases,</td></tr><tr><td>      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end</td></tr></tbody></table>Showing the first 1000 rows.</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Splitting the content with the help of explode and split functions.\n\nfrom
